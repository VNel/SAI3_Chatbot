Introduction The digital revolution has given rise to a new era of warfare, where cyber-attacks and digital strategies play a crucial role in determining the outcomes of conflicts. Turnkey technology has emerged as a powerful tool in this landscape, providing state and non-state actors with advanced capabilities to conduct cyber warfare [1]. Turnkey technology refers to pre-built, ready-to-use software and hardware systems that can be easily implemented with minimal customization or setup. These systems are designed to provide users with a comprehensive solution that can be quickly deployed to achieve specific objectives. Turnkey technology encompasses many tools and systems in cyber warfare, including malware, exploit kits, command and control servers, and even full-scale offensive cyber capabilities [2]. These technologies can be acquired off-the-shelf, allowing users to quickly and efficiently execute cyber attacks or defensive measures without the need for extensive technical expertise or resources. Cyber warfare has evolved significantly since its inception. In the early days, cyber attacks were often limited to basic hacking attempts and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. However, as technology advanced and the internet became an integral part of everyday life, cyber warfare began to take on new forms. State-sponsored cyber attacks and espionage emerged, targeting critical infrastructure, political organizations, and military systems. High-profile attacks, such as Stuxnet, which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, and the NotPetya ransomware, which caused widespread damage globally, have demonstrated the growing sophistication and scale of cyber warfare[3,4]. The rise of turnkey technology has played a significant role in this evolution, enabling a more comprehensive range of actors to engage in cyber warfare. By providing an easily accessible means to launch cyber attacks, turnkey technology has effectively democratized cyber warfare capabilities, creating new opportunities and challenges for state and non-state actors [5,6]. * Corresponding Author: bouke@ieee.org Page 2 of 11 The increasing prevalence of turnkey technology in cyber warfare has had significant implications for modern conflicts. The rapid deployment and adaptability of turnkey systems make them an attractive option for states and non-state actors seeking to project power and influence in the digital realm. As a result, turnkey technology has become an integral component of many military and intelligence operations, as well as asymmetric warfare strategies employed by smaller nations and non-state actors [7,8]. Furthermore, the low cost and ease of access to turnkey technology have led to the proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities across the globe. This has heightened the potential for cyber conflict between nations and created new risks and vulnerabilities, as non-state actors such as terrorist organizations, hacktivists, and criminal networks can now exploit these technologies for their purposes. Consequently, integrating turnkey technology into modern conflicts has introduced new dimensions to warfare and necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its implications for global security and stability. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a comprehensive literature review, providing an overview of turnkey technology and its role in cyber warfare. Section 3 delves into real-world examples of turnkey technology as a cyber warfare weapon, showcasing the diverse nature of its application. Section 4 offers a critical discussion and analysis of the examples, highlighting the key factors that differentiate them and the implications of using turnkey technology in cyber warfare. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the main findings and emphasizing the importance of understanding and preparing for the evolving landscape of cyber warfare as turnkey technology continues to advance and become more accessible. 2. Literature Review The emergence of turnkey technology in cyber warfare has garnered significant attention in academic and policy- making circles. As the threat posed by turnkey technology in cyber warfare grows, researchers emphasize the importance of developing effective countermeasures to protect critical infrastructure and prevent catastrophic cyber- attacks. This literature review explores key works in the field, focusing on turnkey technology development, its application in cyber warfare, and potential countermeasures to mitigate associated risks. Cavelty [9] explores the concept of cyber-power within the European Union's (EU) cyber-security policy. It highlights the multifaceted nature of cyber-power and proposes two notions: (1) a narrow understanding focusing on a political entity's "cyber-fitness," and (2) a broader understanding that views cyber-power as an auxiliary type of power for internal and external political purposes. The authors emphasize the need for future research to examine both aspects and their implications for the EU's role in global politics. Jensen [10] examines the challenges that NATO faces in coordinating offensive cyberspace operations capabilities (OCOC) among its members. Due to the sensitive and secretive nature of OCOCs, NATO members have legitimate interests in maintaining secrecy around these capabilities, resulting in a dilemma for the alliance. The article argues that while NATO's current limited approach to OCOC coordination is pragmatic, real-world inhibitions to information sharing may be moderated by factors such as external threats and the evolving maturity of the cyber domain. Turnkey technology, also known as "off-the-shelf" or "plug-and-play" technology, refers to pre-packaged solutions that can be easily deployed with minimal customization or technical expertise [11]. The adoption of turnkey technology in cyberwarfare has grown in recent years, as evidenced by the increasing number of cyber-attacks using these tools [12]. Kostyuk and Zhukov [12] argue that the proliferation of turnkey technology has lowered the barriers to entry for state and non-state actors, enabling even those with limited resources to conduct sophisticated cyber- attacks. The democratization of cyberwarfare capabilities is a significant concern among security experts [13]. With the availability of turnkey technology, small states, and non-state actors can potentially access advanced cyber capabilities previously reserved for powerful nation-states [14]. Rid, and Buchanan [15] argue that this development may lead to a more volatile cyber landscape as actors with different motivations and objectives gain access to powerful cyber weapons. Page 3 of 11 The rise of turnkey technology in cyberwarfare has significant implications for the strategies employed by state and non-state actors. Smeets [16] posits that the proliferation of turnkey technology may also lead to increased deterrence as states become more aware of their vulnerabilities and improve their cyber defenses. In conclusion, this literature underscores the increasing risks associated with democratizing cyber capabilities and their potential consequences for national security and international stability. Although researchers have suggested several countermeasures to alleviate these risks, additional research is required to fully comprehend the evolving cyber landscape and identify the most effective strategies to tackle the threats posed by turnkey technology. 3. Turnkey Technology as Cyber Warfare Weapon – Real-World Examples This section will explore real-world examples of turnkey technology used as a cyber warfare weapon. These cases were selected based on their relevance to understanding the role of turnkey technology in cyber warfare, its potential risks, and its impact on the balance of power in cyberspace.

Page 5 of 11 3.3. Example 3: NotPetya Attack The NotPetya attack in June 2017 was a highly destructive cyber attack that targeted businesses, government institutions, and critical infrastructure worldwide [4]. Initially believed to be a ransomware attack similar to WannaCry, it was later determined to be a wiper malware with the primary objective of causing widespread damage and disruption. NotPetya is attributed to the Russian government and targeted Ukraine most heavily, affecting the country's government, banks, and power grid [24–26]. Turnkey Aspects of NotPetya: • Rapid Propagation: NotPetya demonstrated the ability of turnkey technology to spread across networks and rapidly inflict damage on targeted systems. The malware used worm-like propagation methods and credential-stealing techniques, enabling it to infect many systems quickly and efficiently. This rapid propagation is a crucial characteristic of turnkey technology in cyber warfare, allowing for swift and widespread attacks. • Weaponizing Legitimate Tools: To further its objectives, NotPetya weaponized legitimate software tools, such as the system management tool PsExec and the credential-dumping tool Mimikatz. This highlights the risks of turnkey technology in cyber warfare, as it demonstrates how existing tools can be repurposed and combined with malicious intent to create devastating cyber weapons. • Destructive Impact: Unlike typical ransomware attacks, NotPetya was designed primarily to cause damage and disruption. The malware encrypted the victim's data and made it nearly impossible to recover, resulting in significant financial losses and operational disruptions. This showcases the potential of turnkey technology to be utilized for destructive purposes in cyber warfare, causing a widespread and lasting impact on targeted systems and organizations. • Difficult Attribution: The attribution of the NotPetya attack to the Russian government was challenging due to its use of multiple obfuscation techniques, such as using legitimate tools and the ransomware disguise. This highlights another risk of turnkey technology in cyber warfare, as it enables state and non-state actors to conduct cyber operations while hiding their involvement, complicating the dynamics of cyber warfare. • Geopolitical Implications: The NotPetya attack had significant geopolitical implications, as it was attributed to the Russian government and primarily targeted Ukraine, exacerbating existing tensions between the two countries. This demonstrates the potential of turnkey technology to be used as a strategic tool in cyber warfare, influencing the balance of power in cyberspace and contributing to geopolitical instability. • Countermeasures and Lessons Learned: The NotPetya attack underscored the importance of robust incident response planning and the need for organizations to invest in cybersecurity resilience.

This case underscores the need for a broader discussion on the ethical implications of using turnkey technology in cyber warfare and the development of international norms and regulations to govern its use. 3.6. Analysis and comparisons of the real-world examples In this section, we critically analyzed the use of turnkey technology as a cyber warfare tool, focusing on five real- world examples: Stuxnet, WannaCry Ransomware, NotPetya Attack, DDoS-for-Hire Services, and China's 5G (Huawei). To better understand and compare these examples, we included a table that presents critical factors such as Attribution Complexity, Impact on Infrastructure, Level of Expertise Required, and Potential for Escalation. Table 1 Comparison of Key Turnkey Technology Cyber Warfare Examples. Example Attribution Complexity Impact on Infrastructure Level of Expertise Required Potential for Escalation Stuxnet High High High Moderate WannaCry Ransomware Moderate High Low Low NotPetya Attack High High Moderate Moderate DDoS-for-Hire Services Low Moderate Low Low China's 5G (Huawei) Moderate High High Moderate As seen in Table 1 above, the examples differ in various aspects, underscoring the versatility of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. Stuxnet demonstrates the potential for high attribution complexity, significant infrastructure impact, and the necessity for advanced expertise. However, it also highlights the risk of unintentional escalation, as the malware inadvertently spreads beyond its intended targets. WannaCry Ransomware, on the other hand, showcases how less-skilled attackers can employ turnkey technology to cause substantial damage to infrastructure. Despite its moderate attribution complexity, the ransomware attack had a relatively low potential for escalation, as it was primarily financially motivated. The NotPetya Attack shared similarities with Stuxnet and WannaCry regarding attribution complexity and infrastructure impact. However, it required a moderate level of expertise and had a reasonable potential for escalation, as the attack was primarily aimed at causing disruption rather than financial gain. DDoS-for-Hire Services exemplify the accessibility of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. These services require minimal expertise, have low attribution complexity, and generally have moderate infrastructure impact. While they also have a low potential for escalation, their widespread availability increases the likelihood of such attacks occurring. The concerns surrounding China's 5G technology, particularly the involvement of Huawei, illustrate the potential risks associated with turnkey technology in cyber warfare. Despite the company's denial of wrongdoing, the potential impact on infrastructure is high, given the pervasive nature of 5G networks. As the infrastructure necessary for Page 8 of 11 providing advanced communication capabilities can also be perceived as a potential tool for cyber espionage or attacks, the attribution complexity, in this case is moderate. The expertise required to exploit 5G technology for cyber warfare would be high, as it involves tampering with sophisticated communication equipment and bypassing security measures. The potential for escalation is also moderate. Countries concerned about the security risks associated with Huawei's 5G technology may resort to retaliatory measures or implement policies restricting its usage, increasing tensions between nations. Addressing these concerns requires a collaborative effort among governments, private companies, and international organizations to establish trust, transparency, and common standards for Cybersecurity in next-generation communication technologies. This example further underscores the challenges associated with turnkey technology in cyber warfare and emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in addressing the related challenges. In conclusion, comparing these real-world examples emphasizes the diverse nature of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. The cases demonstrate that various actors can utilize these tools, from highly skilled nation-states to relatively unskilled individuals. Moreover, they highlight the varying degrees of attribution complexity, infrastructure impact, and potential for escalation resulting from turnkey technology as a cyber warfare tool. As such, governments, organizations, and individuals must understand and prepare for the ever-evolving landscape of cyber warfare, particularly as turnkey technology advances and becomes more accessible. The need for international cooperation, establishing trust, and developing legal and ethical frameworks is crucial in addressing the challenges posed by the proliferation of turnkey technology in cyber warfare and ultimately contributing to a more secure and stable cyberspace environment. 4. Discussion The democratization of cyber warfare tools through turnkey technology has resulted in a more volatile and unpredictable landscape. In this paper, we have delved into the role of turnkey technology in cyber warfare by analyzing various real-world examples and highlighting its potential risks, impact, and implications for the balance of power in cyberspace. This section provides a more detailed and critical discussion of the findings. One of the most significant challenges posed by turnkey technology in cyber warfare is the rapid evolution and adaptation of these tools. With the rapid advancement of technology, threat actors can easily modify and update their turnkey tools to bypass security measures, making it difficult for defenders to keep up. This dynamic nature of turnkey technology, coupled with its ease of use, exacerbates the threats associated with cyber warfare. Secondly, turnkey technology in cyber warfare has blurred the lines between state-sponsored and non-state actors, complicating attribution and response efforts. This ambiguity further complicates the development of effective cyber policies and international norms. In some cases, turnkey technology can be used as a smokescreen to hide the true intentions or identity of the attacker, making it difficult for governments and organizations to determine appropriate countermeasures and retaliatory actions. Additionally, the widespread use of turnkey technology has created a situation where the level of expertise required to engage in cyber warfare has significantly decreased. This has led to a new breed of cybercriminals, referred to as "script kiddies," who have little to no technical knowledge but can still carry out sophisticated attacks using turnkey tools. This phenomenon has expanded the pool of potential threat actors, making it more challenging for organizations to protect against and respond to cyber threats. Moreover, the proliferation of turnkey technology has raised concerns over the potential for cyber warfare to escalate into kinetic warfare. As these tools enable more actors to engage in cyber warfare, the likelihood of misunderstandings, misattributions, and unintended consequences increases. This, in turn, could potentially result in a retaliatory cycle that escalates beyond cyberspace and into the physical domain, increasing the risk of conflict between nations. The growing reliance on turnkey technology in cyber warfare has also raised questions regarding the ethics of using such tools. The ease of access to these technologies may lead to a lower threshold for engaging in cyber warfare, potentially resulting in more frequent and indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure and systems. This highlights Page 9 of 11 the need for a broader discussion on the ethical implications of using turnkey technology in cyber warfare and the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks to guide the use of these tools. Furthermore, the role of the private sector in developing and distributing turnkey technology is another critical aspect to consider. In many cases, private companies produce and distribute turnkey tools that can be repurposed for cyber warfare. This raises questions about the responsibility and accountability of these companies and the need for increased regulation and oversight to prevent the misuse of their products. The importance of international cooperation in addressing the challenges posed by turnkey technology in cyber warfare cannot be overstated. Countries must establish common standards, share intelligence, and collaborate on developing effective defensive and offensive strategies to counter the risks associated with turnkey technology. Finally, the potential for cyber warfare to become a more significant aspect of geopolitical conflict as turnkey technology becomes more accessible should not be overlooked. As turnkey technology proliferates, cyber warfare may become an increasingly prominent tool for nation-states to exert power and influence, leading to a greater need for international norms and agreements to prevent escalatory and destabilizing actions in cyberspace. In conclusion, the extended discussion highlights the complexities and challenges associated with the widespread use of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. The democratization of cyber warfare tools, the blurring of lines between state-sponsored and non-state actors, the emergence of "script kiddies," the potential escalation of cyber warfare into kinetic warfare, the ethical implications of using turnkey technology, the role of the private sector in the development and distribution of turnkey tools, the importance of international cooperation, and the potential for cyber warfare to become a more significant aspect of geopolitical conflict are all critical aspects that need to be considered when addressing the challenges posed by the proliferation of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. To tackle these challenges, governments, organizations, and individuals must develop a multifaceted approach, including policy development, technological innovation, international cooperation, and increased awareness of the risks and consequences of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. By doing so, we can better understand and prepare for the ever-evolving landscape of cyber warfare, particularly as turnkey technology advances and becomes more accessible. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, this paper has provided a critical analysis of the role of turnkey technology in cyber warfare, emphasizing its potential risks, impact, and implications for the balance of power in cyberspace. We have demonstrated the widespread availability and use of turnkey technology in cyber warfare through real-world examples and have underscored the dangers and complexities associated with its proliferation. As the cyberspace landscape continues to evolve and become more interconnected, governments, organizations, and cybersecurity professionals must stay vigilant and understand the role and implications of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. This understanding can help inform the development of effective strategies, policies, and technological innovations to address the challenges posed by turnkey technology, ultimately contributing to a more secure and stable cyberspace environment. Future research could delve deeper into developing specific countermeasures and policy initiatives tailored to mitigate the risks associated with different types of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. Additionally, investigating the role of international cooperation, public-private partnerships, and establishing global cybersecurity norms could provide valuable insights into addressing the challenges posed by the proliferation of turnkey technology in cyber warfare. Exploring the ethical implications of turnkey technology and creating ethical guidelines for its use can also contribute to a more reliable and secure cyberspace. As turnkey technology advances, fostering a collaborative approach will be crucial in navigating the ever-changing cyber warfare landscape.
