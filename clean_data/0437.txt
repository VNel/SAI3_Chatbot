Critical Infrastructure Security: Penetration Testing and Exploit Development Perspectives Papa Kobina Orleans-Bosomtwe School of Computer Science, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada July 25, 2024 Abstract Critical infrastructure refers to essential phys- ical and cyber systems vital to the functioning and stability of societies and economies. These systems include key sectors such as healthcare, energy, and water supply, which are crucial for societal and economic stability and are increas- ingly becoming prime targets for malicious ac- tors, including state-sponsored hackers, seeking to disrupt national security and economic sta- bility. This paper reviews literature on critical infrastructure security, focusing on penetration testing and exploit development. It explores four main questions: the characteristics of critical in- frastructure, the role and challenges of penetra- tion testing, methodologies of exploit develop- ment, and the contribution of these practices to security and resilience. The findings of this pa- per reveal inherent vulnerabilities in critical in- frastructure and sophisticated threats posed by cyber adversaries. Penetration testing is high- lighted as a vital tool for identifying and address- ing security weaknesses, allowing organizations to fortify their defenses. Additionally, under- standing exploit development helps anticipate and mitigate potential threats, leading to more robust security measures. The review under- scores the necessity of continuous and proactive security assessments, advocating for integrating penetration testing and exploit development into regular security protocols. By doing so, organi- zations can preemptively identify and mitigate risks, enhancing the overall resilience of critical infrastructure. The paper concludes by empha- sizing the need for ongoing research and collab- oration between the public and private sectors to develop innovative solutions for the evolving cyber threat landscape. This comprehensive re- view aims to provide a foundational understand- ing of critical infrastructure security and guide future research and practices. Keywords: Cybersecurity, penetration test- ing, exploit development, critical infrastructure. 1 Introduction Critical infrastructure includes the physical and cyber systems and assets essential for the uninterrupted functioning of a nation’s society and economy [1, 2]. This includes healthcare, public health, energy, and information technol- ogy sectors. Over the years, advances in tech- nology and information technology systems have improved many essential systems, making life 1 arXiv:2407.17256v1 [cs.CR] 24 Jul 2024 easier for relevant users and operators. It is not shocking to discover critical infrastructure firms’ assimilation and adoption of newer tech- nological systems to improve efficiency and out- put. The threats to technology increased with the progress and advancements over the years. Technological threats have become as sophisti- cated (sometimes more refined) as their counter- parts. These threats can then be transferred to technologies used in critical infrastructure sys- tems. Cyber attackers, who pose said threats to technological systems, utilize various means to cause harm to systems. A survey in 2023 was conducted to find the primary cause of cyber- attacks Figure 1 encountered by companies in the United States, which showed unpatched vul- nerabilities, attributing to 23% of these causes. Penetration testing is basically an analysis of some aspects of a system [3, 4], with the discov- eries used to improve the security and resilience of tested systems and networks by crafting new exploits or using existing ones to test systems further. Figure 2 shows the number of com- mon IT security vulnerabilities and exposures worldwide (CVEs) from 2009 to 2024. This pa- per aims to assess the existing security and re- silience of critical infrastructure using penetra- tion testing and exploit development by answer- ing 4 main research questions. These research questions are ”What is critical infrastructure?”, ”What is penetration testing?”, ”What is ex- ploit development?”, and ”How can penetration testing and exploit development improve critical infrastructure security and resilience?”. These questions are being posed due to the information and understanding they can provide to readers of this paper. Answering these questions in the order they have been asked will help readers un- derstand what critical infrastructure is, how im- portant it is, and how the remaining concepts which are penetration testing, and exploit devel- opment tie in in the security of critical infras- tructure. These questions will be answered by reviewing pre-existent studies around these key areas: critical infrastructure, penetration test- ing, and exploit development. Figure 1: Primary causes of cyber-attacks in the US in 2023 2 Literature Review Upon the first search of related artifacts, it was discovered that some articles related to crit- ical infrastructure security from a cybersecu- rity standpoint. Dating to as recently as 2021, Makrakis et al. [1] note the growing integration of modern information technology by critical infrastructure and industrial organizations into their existing operational technology (OT) archi- tectures. They point out that the ever-increasing attack surfaces of these new modern technology integrations provide malicious attackers, owing to their complexity and modernity, which, in turn, also handicap the defenders of these sys- 2 Figure 2: Number of common IT security vulner- abilities and exposures worldwide (CVEs) from 2009 to 2024 tems. This paper then follows up with a sur- vey of the most prevalent threats against indus- trial control systems and critical infrastructures at the time, exposing vulnerabilities in specific operational technology (OT) network protocols and devices. The authors also explore some ma- licious software (malware) that has targeted crit- ical infrastructure in the past, highlighting how social engineering has been a significant attack vector for adversaries. 2021 also saw Malatji et al. [5] reviewing critical infrastructure and cybersecurity in general, focusing on the grow- ing interconnectivity between Enterprise Infor- mation Technology (IT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The authors note that this grow- ing connectivity also poses increasing dangers to operators and organizations regarding the new attack surfaces they present to malicious attack- ers. The paper also discusses the cybersecurity framework proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for critical in- frastructure, noting its customization potential and inclusion of cloud capabilities and security in the modern world. A paper by Ghafir et al. [6] in 2018 points out threats to critical in- frastructure, focusing on humans, classified as “non-computer experts.” The authors acknowl- edge current security awareness training plat- forms and tools and highlight their shortcom- ings. Using prior research, the authors note that the knowledge retention rate after completing a security awareness training session or campaign was low. Their paper proposes a “context-aware education tool” for security awareness, where training is related to the current business en- vironment, with platform administrators able to monitor and track users’ progress. The studies mentioned above all note the growing cybersecu- rity risks facing Critical Infrastructure (CI) ICS as they get updated and integrated with modern IT systems and networks. They do not, however, explore penetration testing and exploit develop- ment perspectives in improving the security of CI and ensuring their resilience. This paper aims to review further work done in this capacity to be a guide for future research activities [7]. 3 Research Goals This paper aims to review existing studies on critical infrastructure security, penetration test- ing, and exploit development, and the utiliza- tion of penetration testing and exploit develop- ment to enhance critical infrastructure security and resilience. • A total of 32 different articles and studies were discovered relating to critical infras- tructure, its security, and penetration test- ing and exploit development. • After further review, 13 of the previous 32 3 Research Questions Description RQ1: What is critical infrastructure?

Table 2: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 4.3 Data Extraction After going through the first and second screening steps, the papers that were finally se- lected had their data extracted. This data was extracted to evaluate the accuracy of informa- tion provided in the chosen texts. The data ex- traction process was first carried out on 3 out of the final 13 papers and was then applied to the remaining ten papers, with the data then get- ting categorized and stored for later use. The categories gained from the extracted data are as follows: • Context data: This includes all informa- tion about the purpose of the study. • Qualitative data: This includes the find- ings, proposals, and conclusions proposed by the studies’ authors. 4.4 Significant Keyword Counts In addition to the keywords utilized in search- ing for these papers, various other keywords were discovered in the selected texts. These keywords have been listed and compiled, with their given counts in Table 3. The aim of Table 3 is to accu- mulate the number of times selected keywords appeared in the 13 studies selected. Observ- ing the keyword counts in Table 3, it can be noted that the prevailing theme across the se- lected studies is “cybersecurity,” with a count of 375. 5 Findings After carefully reading selected primary texts, relevant information related to this paper was extracted, including contextual and qualitative data. From the percentages in Figure 4, it can be determined that 27% of the selected studies were concerned with cybersecurity. The next most prevalent themes in the selected studies were critical infrastructure and penetration test- ing, each with a 15% distribution. Critical in- frastructure being our main focus of this conver- sation and penetration testing being an aid in discovering some misconfigurations within criti- cal infrastructure systems. At 14%, the keyword “exploits” comes in as the fourth most discussed theme in the selected texts. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are typically used in industrial control devices and systems had a 13% rate of discussion within the selected texts. Threats, mostly digital and within the cyber space have a 10% discussion in the selected studies. Threats are the dan- gers that industrial control systems and critical infrastructure face. Industrial control systems usually found being used in Critical infrastruc- ture had a 6% distribution within the selected discussion papers. The selected studies all dis- cussed the topics intended to meet their intended capacities. These studies were chosen because they sufficiently described and explained the rel- evant topics in this paper which are critical in- 5 Keywords Count critical infrastructure. 213 industrial control system 80 penetration testing/tests 208 cybersecurity 375 power system control 6 SCADA 176 exploit 189 threats 145 Table 3: Significant Keyword Counts frastructure, penetration testing, exploit devel- opment, and cybersecurity. A number of stud- ies highlight the services and systems (IT) that are used in critical infrastructure and their gross misconfigurations. The importance of critical in- frastructure penetration testing is also discussed, with some studies diving deeper into the impor- tance of penetration testing and cybersecurity in critical infrastructure[8, 9]. Figure 3: Distribution of Prevalent Themes 6 Discussion The keyword searches conducted on the selected papers show a relevant interest in critical infras- tructure security, penetration testing, and ex- ploit development. The significance of critical in- frastructure is well established in several of these studies, with a significant number also recogniz- ing the growing risks these infrastructures face as they modernize their IT systems and other con- trol systems. The papers have significant quali- tative data regarding the chosen topics but need more practical solutions. Some valuable solu- tions offered are revisions of currently existing methodologies with some improvements. About penetration testing in these studies, the act is de- fined and well explained, with light also shed on the different types of penetration tests. Penetra- tion testing tools were discussed, and a combi- nation of these tools and other platforms was ex- plored to simplify penetration testing. Address- ing the critical infrastructure, a number of pa- pers attempt to define CI and industrial control systems. The papers note that ICS were initially believed to be safe and free from possible cyber- attacks but increasing attacks on CI and ICS have changed this belief. IT and cybersecurity 6 teams are now attempting to quantify the cyber risks CI and ICS are exposed to and are finding it difficult to do so. Multiple ICS and OT network environments have been discovered to be miscon- figured and are easy to exploit. Penetration test- ing and red teaming activities have been shown to help discover said misconfigurations. Other researchers also propose using testbeds to dis- cover cybersecurity vulnerabilities within ICS. Some authors of the selected studies attempt to develop penetration system specific to large net- works found in CI by simulating complex human or automated attacks. Solutions proposed by au- thors include the integration of artificial intelli- gence and machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent potential cyber-attacks against ICS found within CI. The research also discovered that some definitions of Critical Infrastructure were inadequate, which could lead to some gaps in security as networks and systems for critical infrastructure were not properly categorized. CI must be well-defined, and assets, including sys- tems and other products, must be correctly iden- tified and labeled. The identified assets must be protected at all costs throughout their entire life- cycle. The remaining discoveries are tabulated in Figures 4-7 below. 6.1 RQ1. What is Critical Infrastruc- ture? Critical infrastructure can be defined as com- plex physical and cyber-based systems that form the lifeline of a modern society [10, 11]. Some sectors in Critical Infrastructure include trans- port, energy, food, water, finance, and health [12]. For various functions, industrial control systems are widely used in CI and are typically used to control different infrastructures like man- ufacturing [13]. The ICS architecture found in Figure 4: Key Findings CI typically consists of 6 levels. These levels range from sensors providing sensing capabilities to a system, to manufacturing operations sys- tems used to manage production at any CI site [1, 14]. The sentence before was added to paint a picture of just how complex ICS and CI can get and how all the systems found within the ICS archcitecture require security on varying levels to protect them from cyber attacks. 6.2 RQ2. What is Penetration Test- ing? Penetration testing is a structured process to test an organization’s computing base, which in- cludes hardware, software, and people [15]. The adopted frameworks differ in the number of pen- etration testing phases they offer. For example, 7 Figure 5: Key Findings continued the National Institute of Standards and Tech- nology Special Publication (NIST SP) 800-115 has four stages, whereas the penetration testing execution standard (PTES) has seven. A pene- tration test’s primary objectives are identifying vulnerabilities, reducing risks, and guaranteeing compliance by figuring out how a malevolent ac- tor may enter the target environment, navigate it, and steal data from it. In penetration testing, three main testing methods are typically used, the first being black box. In black box testing, Figure 6: Key Findings continued the team has no information about the tested target [15]. White box testing has testers pro- vided with all information about the test target, while gray box testing has testers provided with partial information [15]. Several tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Nessus are used in various stages of the penetration testing process. 6.3 RQ3. What is Exploit Develop- ment? Exploit development involves identifying vul- nerabilities in applications and software and de- 8 Figure 7: Key Findings continued termining how to gain control of a system [16]. When discussing exploit development, there are two broad categories under which all exploits fall: known and unknown (zero-day) exploits [16]. Both malicious actors and security teams can exploit developments to their advantage. Se- curity team members or researchers can use ex- ploit development to learn more about security flaws within systems or networks, including pos- sible critical failures and the consequences of at- tackers exploiting these vulnerabilities. The in- formation obtained from this exercise can help security team members adequately patch or fix the discovered vulnerabilities to prevent facing the consequences. This information can also be shared with relevant parties to ensure more systems affected by these vulnerabilities are se- cured. While the traditional methods of exploit de- velopment are critical, recent advancements in automated exploit generation tools and machine learning techniques have significantly enhanced the speed and efficacy of this process. Auto- mated exploit generation tools, such as those leveraging symbolic execution and fuzz testing, allow for rapid identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities. These tools can systematically explore numerous execution paths in software to uncover hidden bugs and security flaws that might be missed by manual testing [17]. Recent advancements in automated exploit generation have significantly enhanced the speed and effectiveness of exploit development. Auto- mated exploit generation typically involves au- tomatically discovering paths in a program that trigger vulnerabilities, thereby creating exploits [18]. Tools like AAHEG exemplify the integra- tion of automation in this field. AAHEG utilizes symbolic execution to analyze and detect poten- tial heap-related vulnerabilities in sourcee code, develops an exploit abstract syntax tree, then selects exploitable methods. These methods are then tested and the final exploit is produced. Incorporating these technologies into ex- ploit development can provide security teams with powerful tools to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. This proactive approach is es- sential for maintaining robust security measures against the continuously evolving cyber threat landscape. 6.4 RQ4. How can penetration test- ing and exploit development im- prove critical infrastructure secu- rity and resilience? The general issue with critical infrastructure security and resilience is that cybersecurity is primarily perceived in the context of enterprise IT systems. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) were mistakenly considered impervious to cyber- attacks [5]. Other issues relating to critical in- frastructure include the old age of the systems and technologies used. Legacy systems and older components typically found in critical infrastruc- ture system architectures pose significant prob- lems for CI security teams [19]. These older systems typically lack modern security features to detect or counter contemporary cyber threats and attacks. Penetration testing and exploit de- velopment, when correctly carried out, especially 9 on networks by the relevant parties, can expose vulnerabilities and possible threats to critical in- frastructure. ICS used in CI consist of various levels and are very complex. This requires that security op- erators have deep understandings of the multiple tiers within ICS. Penetration testing, therefore, plays a critical role in ensuring the security and resilience of these systems by addressing vulner- abilities at each level [1] of the architecture: • Level 0 - Sensors, motors, and instru- ments: Penetration testing at this level involves assessing the security of devices that provide sensing capabilities to the ICS. These components are often targeted be- cause they are fundamental to the physical operation of industrial processes. Penetra- tion tests should check for vulnerabilities such as weak authentication mechanisms, insecure communication protocols, and po- tential physical tampering points [20]. • Level 1 - Devices including PLCs: Pro- grammable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are critical as they provide sensory and moni- toring control over physical processes. Com- prehensive penetration tests should focus on identifying flaws in PLC firmware, miscon- figurations, and unsecured connections that could be exploited to disrupt operations or cause physical damage. • Level 2 - Control systems: This level includes Engineering Workstations that su- pervise physical processes. Penetration testing here involves evaluating the security of control systems, ensuring that they are not vulnerable to attacks that could lead to unauthorized changes in operational set- tings or shutdowns [11]. • Level 3 - Plant-wide production work- flow systems: Systems at this level, such as file servers and Microsoft Active Direc- tory, are tested for vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to gain control over the workflow management systems. This in- cludes examining network security, access controls, and potential insider threats. • Level 4 - IT-related activity systems: Systems like application servers and ERP systems are crucial for overseeing IT-related activities. Comprehensive penetration tests will assess these systems for vulnerabilities in web applications, databases, and network interfaces, ensuring they are robust against exploits that could impact the broader en- terprise operations. • Level 5 - Enterprise network: The en- terprise network encompasses both internal and external networks of the organization, used for production and resource data ex- change. Penetration testing should focus on identifying and mitigating risks associ- ated with network perimeter security, re- mote access vulnerabilities, and potential data breaches that could propagate to lower levels [5h, 21]. Emphasis should be placed on network pen- etration testing because numerous incidents at- test that attackers can easily penetrate Op- erational Technology (OT) environments after breaking into IT networks [1]. A comprehensive penetration testing strategy that addresses each layer of the ICS architecture ensures that vul- nerabilities are identified and mitigated across the entire system, thereby improving the secu- rity and resilience of critical infrastructure. 10 Recent advancements in exploit develop- ment, particularly in automated exploit gener- ation (AEG), can significantly enhance penetra- tion testing and overall security of CI and ICS. Automated tools like AAHEG (Automatic Ad- vanced Heap Exploit Generation) leverage sym- bolic execution and abstract syntax trees to automatically identify and exploit heap-related vulnerabilities without requiring source code, ef- fectively bypassing various protection mecha- nisms [18]. Integrating these advanced technologies into penetration testing enables quicker and more ef- ficient identification and mitigation of vulner- abilities, ensuring that security measures are robust and up-to-date against evolving cyber threats. This proactive approach is crucial for maintaining the security and resilience of criti- cal infrastructure and industrial control systems. 7 Conclusion and Future Work Critical Infrastructure is vital to the daily op- eration and working of a society; any disruptions or outages to the services they provide cannot be afforded. Owing to their importance, criti- cal infrastructure security should be taken seri- ously, especially in cyberspace. The growing at- traction of cyber attackers to critical infrastruc- ture is undeniable, and action should be taken. Penetration testing to discover the vulnerabil- ities in essential systems of critical infrastruc- ture, coupled with exploit development to un- derstand the criticality of these vulnerabilities, will spur security teams into immediate action to fix and patch these vulnerabilities and cor- responding systems to prevent exploitation by malicious attackers. The research has shown the benefits of penetration testing and exploit de- velopment and pointed out, as earlier stated, how necessary critical infrastructure is. For future research, I propose that researchers inves- tigate social engineering and securing the human part of any IT system. Social engineering is cur- rently the most common way of committing cy- bercrimes through the intrusion and infection of computer systems [22]. Hypothetically speaking, even if the systems and network of critical infras- tructure manage to be perfectly configured with no potential breach avenues, the one remaining threat will remain the human aspect of these systems. Another risk aspect of the human part of any IT system is insider threats. Insider threats are malicious acts carried out by autho- rized persons, which may cause detrimental im- plications for the digital and physical assets of an organization [23]. More research should be conducted in this respect for mitigation strate- gies and the role penetration testing can play. The final area of suggestion for future research will be artificial intelligence and machine learn- ing. Machine learning and artificial intelligence could play essential roles in automated penetra- tion testing and exploit development to benefit the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure sys- tems.
