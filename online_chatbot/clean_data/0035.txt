arXiv:1603.08314v1 [cs.CR] 28 Mar 2016 Active Cyber Defense Dynamics Exhibiting Rich Phenomena Ren Zheng Fudan University zhrkevin@gmail.com Wenlian Lu Fudan University wenlian@fudan.edu.cn Shouhuai Xu UT San Antonio shxu@cs.utsa.edu ABSTRACT The Internet is a man-made complex system under constant attacks (e.g., Advanced Persistent Threats and malwares). It is therefore important to understand the phenomena that can be induced by the interaction between cyber attacks and cyber defenses. In this paper, we explore the rich phenomena that can be exhibited when the de- fender employs active defense to combat cyber attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that shows that active cyber defense dynamics (or more generally, cybersecurity dynamics) can exhibit the bifurcation and chaos phenomena. This has profound implications for cyber security measurement and prediction: (i) it is infeasible (or even impossible) to accurately measure and predict cyber security under certain circumstances; (ii) the defender must manipulate the dynamics to avoid such unmanageable situations in real-life defense operations.

INTRODUCTION Malicious attacks in cyberspace will remain to be a big problem for the many years to come. This is fundamentally caused by the complexity of the Internet and computer systems (e.g., we cannot assure that a large software system has no security vulnerabilities). It is therefore important to understand and characterize the phe- nomena that can be exhibited at the global level of a cyber system, ranging from an enterprise network to the entire cyberspace. The emerging framework of Cybersecurity Dynamics [34, 35, 7, 4] of- fers a systematic approach for understanding, characterizing, and quantifying the phenomena as well as cyber security in general.

The current generation of cyber defenses is often based on re- active tools that are known to have limited success. For example, infected/compromised computers cannot be cleaned up even by us- ing multiple anti-malware tools together [21]. Moreover, reactive defense has a fundamental limitation, namely that the effect of at- tacks is automatically ampliﬁed by network connectivity, but the effect of reactive defenses is not. This attack-defense asymmetry had been implied by studies such as [29, 6, 3, 28, 39], but was not explicitly pointed out until [36]. One approach to overcoming the aforementioned attack-defense asymmetry is to adopt active cyber defense, which is to use the same mechanism that is exploited by attackers. More speciﬁcally, active defense aims to spread some “white” worms (called defense- ware in this paper) to automatically identify and “kill” the mali- cious malwares in compromised/infected computers [2, 1, 30, 26, 16, 18, 14, 31]. In some sense, active cyber defense already takes place in cyberspace because (for example) the malware called Welchia attempts to “kill" the malware called Blaster in compromised computers [26, 22], but it may take some years for full-scale ac- tive cyber defenses to arise [18, 27, 32]. The ﬁrst mathematical model for studying the global effectiveness of active cyber defense has been proposed recently [36]. In this paper, we further the study of active cyber defense dynamics from a new perspective. Our contributions. We substantially extend some aspects of the ﬁrst mathematical model of active cyber defense dynamics [36] (to be fair, we should note that [36] offers some perspectives that are not considered in our model as well). The extensions can be char- acterized as follows. First, we accommodate more general attack- power and defense-power functions, meaning that our results are applicable to a broader setting than what is investigated in [36]. Second, we allow the attack network structure to be different from the defense network structure, which are assumed to be identical in [36]. This is important and realistic because the attack-defense interaction structures are often “overlay” networks on top of some physical networks, and as such, the defender and the attacker can use different structures based on their own defense/attack strate- gies. The extended model allows us to explore the rich phenomena that can be exhibited by active cyber defense dynamics. Speciﬁ- cally, we show that active cyber defense dynamics can exhibit the bifurcation and chaos phenomena (we call them unmanageable sit- uations in cyber security). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that shows that bifurcation and chaos are relevant in the cyber security domain. These phenomena indicate limitations on the measurement and prediction of cyber security, and highlight that cyber defenders must manipulate the (active) cyber defense dynamics to avoid such unmanageable situations in real-life cyber defense operations. Disclaimer. The active cyber defense strategy explored in the present paper does not advocate that defenders should retaliate from at- tackers, because it is well known that the attackers, or more pre- cisely the IP addresses that are launching attacks against the vic- tims, could well be victims that are abused by the real attackers as stepping stones. Moreover, defensewares (i.e., “white” worms) are meant to clean up the compromised computers, not to compromise the secure computers. Most important of all, the active defense operations should be contained within the networks under the de- fender’s jurisdiction (e.g., an enterprise network defender may use active defense to clean up the enterprise network but not going be- yond the enterprise’s perimeter). This can be assured, for example, by making the enterprise’s computers and ﬁrewalls recognize de- fensewares via digital signatures. This means that the enterprise computers will only run defensewares that are accompanied with digital signatures that can be veriﬁed by the computers’ hardware via an embedded signature veriﬁcation key, and that the ﬁrewall recognizes and blocks out-bound defensewares. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our active cyber defense dynamics model. In Section 3, we analyze equilibria (or attractors) of active cyber defense dynamics. In Section 4, we explore the transition between attractors. In Sec- tion 5, we investigate the emergence of bifurcation. In Section 6, we explore the chaos phenomenon. We discuss related prior work in Section 7 and conclude the paper in Section 8. The main notations we use are summarized as follows.

EXTENDED ACTIVE CYBER DEFENSE DYNAMICS MODEL Review of the model in [36]. Suppose attacker and defender in- teract in a cyber system that consists of a ﬁnite node population V = {1, 2, · · · , n}, where each node can abstract/represent a com- puter. At any time t ≥0, a node v ∈V is in one of two states: blue, meaning that the node is secure but vulnerable to attacks; red, meaning that the node is compromised. For a given cyber system, the attacker spreads computer malwares (e.g., Advanced Persistent Threats) to compromise computers, while the defender spreads defensewares (e.g., “white” worms) to detect and clean up (or “cure") the compromised computers. Suppose both the mal- wares and the defensewares spread over the same attack-defense network structure, namely a ﬁnite simple graph G = (V, E), where V = {1, 2, · · · , n} is the vertex set mentioned above, and E is the edge set such that (u, v) ∈E means (i) a compromised node u can attack a secure node v and (ii) a secure node u can use active defense to detect and clean up a compromised node v. Our extension to the model in [36]. Rather than assuming the at- tacker and defender use the same attack-defense network structure, we consider two network structures: the defense network structure GB = (V, EB) over which defensewares spread, and the attack network structure GR = (V, ER) over which malwares spread. Both network structures are directed or undirected graphs. Specif- ically, (u, v) ∈EB means a secure node u can use active defense to “cure” a compromised node v, and (u, v) ∈ER means a com- promised node u can attack a secure node v. We do not make any restrictions on the attack/defense network structures, except that we assume GB and GR are simple graphs with no self-edges.1 (For the purpose of illustrating results, we will use random graphs as con- crete examples though.) Denote by AB = [aB vu]n×n the adjacency matrix of GB where aB vu = 1 if and only if (u, v) ∈EB. Denote by AR = [aR vu]n×n the adjacency matrix of GR where aR vu = 1 if and only if (u, v) ∈ ER. Note that the representation accommodates both directed and undirected graphs. Denote by Bv(t) and Rv(t) the probability that node v ∈V is in state blue (i.e., secure) and state red (i.e., com- promised) at time t, respectively. B (Blue) R (Red) Tv, BR(t) Tv, RB(t) Figure 1: The state transition diagram for a node v ∈V . Figure 1 depicts the state transition diagram for individual node v ∈V , where θv,RB(t) is the probability that node v’s state changes from red to blue at time t, and θv,BR(t) is the probability that node v’s state changes from blue to red at time t. This leads to the fol- lowing master equation of active cyber defense dynamics:      dBv(t) dt = θv,RB(t) · Rv(t) −θv,BR(t) · Bv(t) dRv(t) dt = θv,BR(t) · Bv(t) −θv,RB(t) · Rv(t) (1) In order to specify θv,RB(t), we use the concept of defense- power function f(·) : [0, 1] →{0} ∪R+, which abstracts the 1It is possible to accommodate privilege escalation in the present model, by treating a computer as a set of nodes that correspond to different privileges. We leave the details to future investigation. power of the defenseware in detecting and cleaning up compro- mised (red) nodes. In order to specify θv,BR(t), we use the concept of attack-power function g(·) : [0, 1] →{0}∪R+, which abstracts the power of the malware in compromising secure (blue) nodes. It is intuitive that both defense-power and attack-power functions should be dependent on the defense and attack network structures, respectively. Therefore, we have the following general form: θv,RB(t) = f   1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu(t)  , θv,BR(t) = g   1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu(t)   where Nv,GB = {u : (u, v) ∈EB} is the set of node v’s neigh- bors in graph GB and Nv,GR = {u : (u, v) ∈ER} is the set of node v’s neighbors in graph GR. For the present characterization study, it is sufﬁcient to require that the defense-power and attack-power functions possess some basic properties. First, we have f(0) = 0 because active defense must be launched from some blue node, and g(1) = 0 because attack must be launched from some red node. Second, we have f(x) > 0 for x ∈(0, 1] because any active defense may succeed, and g(x) > 0 for x ∈[0, 1) because any attack may succeed. Third, the two functions do not have to abide by any speciﬁc re- lation, except that they are differentiable (for the sake of analytic treatment). As a result, the master equation of active cyber defense dynam- ics, namely Eq. (1), becomes: dBv(t) dt = f   1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu(t)  Rv(t) − g   1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu(t)  Bv(t) dRv(t) dt = g   1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu(t)  Bv(t) − f   1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu(t)  Rv(t) Since dBv(t) dt + dRv(t) dt = 0 holds for all t ≥0 and all v ∈V , Bv(t) + Rv(t) = 1 for all t and all v ∈V . Therefore, we only need to consider the following master equation for v ∈V : dBv(t) dt = f   1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu(t)   h 1 −Bv(t) i − g   1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu(t)  Bv(t). (2) The main research task is to analyze system (2) for all v ∈V . Remark. When we investigate speciﬁc attacks and defenses, we need to obtain their concrete attack-power and defense-power func- tions. Similarly, when we investigate speciﬁc cyber systems, we need to obtain the concrete attack and defense network structures. These are important research problems that are orthogonal to the focus of the present paper because our characterization study deals with all possible attack-power and defense-power functions as well as all possible attack and defense network structures. In principle, these functions and structures do exist, although how to obtain them is an excellent problem for future investigation. 3. EQUILIBRIA AND THEIR STABILITY Equilibrium is an important concept for quantifying cyber secu- rity. Suppose σ is the equilibrium under certain active defense. We can quantify the effectiveness of active defense via the notion of σ-effectiveness because the dynamics converge to σ. Moreover, the stability of an equilibrium reﬂects the consequence/effect of per- turbations, which can be caused (for example) by manipulations to the initial global state (e.g., the defender manually cleans up some compromised computers before launching active defense for more effectiveness — this may sound counterintuitive, but it actu- ally shows the value of rigorous characterization study because the defender would not know this tactics otherwise). We consider a class of equilibria of Eq. (2), namely homoge- neous equilibria [B∗ 1, · · · , B∗ n] with B∗ 1 = . . . = B∗ n = σ ∈[0, 1]. This class contains the following: • All-blue equilibrium, denoted by B∗= 1; B∗ v = 1 for all v ∈V (i.e., active defense is 1-effective). • All-red equilibrium, denoted by B∗= 0; B∗ v = 0 for all v ∈V (i.e., active defense is 0-effective). • σ-equilibrium, denoted by B∗= σ ∈(0, 1); B∗ v = σ for all v ∈V (i.e., active cyber defense is σ-effective). The Jacobian matrix of (2) near an equilibrium is denoted by M = h (1 −σ)f ′(σ)D−1 ABAB −σg′(σ)D−1 ARAR i − h f(σ) + g(σ) i In. (3) 3.1 Existence and Stability of Equilibria We show that homogeneous equilibria exist under the following hypothesis (or condition): H0: there exists some σ ∈[0, 1] such that (1 −σ) · f(σ) = σ · g(σ) holds. PROPOSITION 1. Under hypothesis H0, B∗= σ ∈[0, 1] is an equilibrium of (2). Moreover, B∗is stable if ℜ(µ) < 0 for all µ ∈λ(M), and unstable if ℜ(µ) > 0 for some µ ∈λ(M). PROOF. Under hypothesis H0, namely (1−σ)·f(σ) = σ·g(σ), we see that B∗ v = σ satisﬁes dBv(t) dt = (1 −σ) · f(σ) −σ · g(σ) = 0, ∀v ∈V. Thus B∗= σ is an equilibrium. To see the stability of equilibrium B∗= σ ∈[0, 1], we consider a small perturbation to B∗, namely δB = [B1 −B∗ 1, · · · , Bn − B∗ n]. The linearization system of Eq. (2) near B∗leads to dδB dt = h (1 −σ)f ′(σ)D−1 ABAB −σg′(σ)D−1 ARAR i − h f(σ) + g(σ) i In  δB, (4) where In is the identity matrix of size n. Note that M as deﬁned in Eq. (3) is the coefﬁcient matrix of linear system (4). The stability of equilibrium B∗= σ is determined by the eigenvalues of matrix M. For the general case GB = (V, EB) ̸= GR = (V, ER), it can be shown that λ(M) = λ  (1 −σ)f ′(σ)D−1 ABAB − σg′(σ)D−1 ARAR  − h f(σ) + g(σ) i . (5) If ℜ(µ) < 0 for all µ ∈λ(Mσ), B∗= σ is locally stable; if ℜ(µ) > 0 for some µ ∈λ(M), B∗= σ is locally unstable. Proposition 1 can be simpliﬁed when σ = 0 and σ = 1. COROLLARY 1. If g(1) = 0, then B∗= 1 is an equilibrium. It is locally stable if −g′(1) < f(1) and locally unstable if −g′(1) > f(1). If f(0) = 0, then B∗= 0 is an equilibrium. It is locally stable if f ′(0) < g(0) and locally unstable if f ′(0) > g(0). PROOF. To prove the ﬁrst part, we observe that g(1) = 0 im- plies H0 holds for σ = 1, namely that B∗= 1 is an equilibrium of system (2). For σ = 1, it can be shown that Eq. (4) becomes dδB dt = = h −g′(1)D−1 ARAR −f(1)In i δB. Proposition 1 says that a sufﬁcient condition under which equilib- rium B∗= 1 is locally stable is −g′(1)ℜ(µ) < f(1), ∀µ ∈λ  D−1 ARAR  . (6) Since g(1) = 0 and g(x) ≥0 for x ∈[0, 1], g(x) is locally non-increasing at x = 1 and thus −g′(1) ≥0. Since the sum for every row in matrix D−1 ARAR equals 1, the Perron-Frobenius theorem [10] says that its largest eigenvalue is 1. From Eq. (6), we have −g′(1)ℜ(µ) < −g′(1) < f(1), ∀µ ∈λ  D−1 ARAR  . That is, if −g′(1) < f(1), then B∗= 1 is locally stable; if −g′(1) > f(1), there exists at least one eigenvalue µ0 ∈λ  D−1 ARAR  , say µ0 = 1, such that −g′(1)ℜ(µ0) −f(1) > 0, meaning that B∗= 1 is locally unstable. To prove the second part, we observe that f(0) = 0 implies H0 with σ = 0, namely that B∗= 0 is an equilibrium of (2). For σ = 0, Eq. (4) becomes dδB dt = h (1 −0) · f ′(0)D−1 ABAB −0 · g′(0)D−1 ARAR i − h f(0) + g(0) i In  δB = h f ′(0)D−1 ABAB −g(0)In i δB. Proposition 1 says that the sufﬁcient condition for equilibrium B∗= 0 to be locally stable is f ′(0)ℜ(µ) < g(0), ∀µ ∈λ  D−1 ABAB  . (7) Since f(0) = 0 and f(x) ≥0 for x ∈[0, 1], f(x) is locally non-decreasing at x = 0 and thus f ′(0) ≥0. Since the largest eigenvalue of D−1 ABAB is 1, from Eq. (7) we have f ′(0)ℜ(µ) < f ′(0) < g(0), ∀µ ∈λ  D−1 ABAB  . That is, if f ′(0) < g(0), then B∗= 0 is locally stable; if f ′(0) > g(0), there exists at least one eigenvalue µ0 ∈λ  D−1 ABAB  , say µ0 = 1, such that f ′(0)ℜ(µ0) −g(0) > 0, meaning that B∗= 0 is locally unstable. In the special case GB = GR, namely AB = AR, we immedi- ately obtain the following corollary of Proposition 1: COROLLARY 2. Suppose hypothesis H0 holds and GB = GR = G (i.e., AB = AR = A). Let µ1 be the eigenvalue of D−1 A A that has the smallest real part. If the attack-power and defense-power functions satisfy one of the following two conditions: (i). (1−σ)f ′(σ)−σg′(σ) > 0 and f(σ) + g(σ) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) > 1, (ii). (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) < 0 and f(σ) + g(σ) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) < ℜ(µ1), then equilibrium B∗= σ ∈[0, 1] is locally stable. If the attack-power and defense-power functions satisfy one of the two following conditions: (i). (1−σ)f ′(σ)−σg′(σ) > 0 and f(σ) + g(σ) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) < 1, (ii). (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) < 0 and f(σ) + g(σ) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) > ℜ(µ1), then equilibrium B∗= σ ∈[0, 1] is locally unstable. 3.2 Examples Example 1: Stability effect of different defense-power functions vs. a ﬁxed attack-power function. Suppose GB = GR is an Erdös-Rényi (ER) random graph instance G = (V, E) with |V | = 2, 000 and edge probability p = 0.005 (i.e., every pair of nodes is connected with probability 0.005, independent of each other). We consider attack-power function g(x) = 1−x against the following four scenarios of defense-power function f(x): • Scenario I: f(x) = x2, meaning that B∗= 0 is stable and B∗= 1 is unstable. • Scenario II: f(x) = x2+x, meaning that B∗= 0 is unstable and B∗= 1 is stable. • Scenario III: f(x) = x2 + 1 2x, meaning that B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 are stable, but B∗= 1 2 is unstable. • Scenario IV: f(x) = −2x2 + 2x, meaning that B∗= 1 2 is stable, but B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 are unstable. Figure 2 plots the phase portraits of ⟨Bv(t)⟩= 1 |V | P v∈V Bv(t), the portion of secure nodes. We observe that the simulation results conﬁrm the analytic results. Speciﬁcally, Figure 2(a) shows that ⟨Bv(t)⟩converges to B∗= 0 when Bv(0) < 1 for all v ∈V ; Fig- ure 2(b) shows that ⟨Bv(t)⟩converges to B∗= 1 when Bv(0) > 0 for all v ∈V ; Figure 2(c) shows that ⟨Bv(t)⟩converges to B∗= 1 when Bv(0) > 0.5 for all v ∈V and converges to B∗= 0 when Bv(0) < 0.5 for all v ∈V ; Figure 2(d) shows that ⟨Bv(t)⟩con- verges to B∗= 0.5 when 0 < Bv(0) < 1 for all v ∈V . time t f(x) g(x) B∗ [0, 150] f(x) = x2 + x g(x) = 1 −x B∗= 1 [150, 300] f(x) = x2 g(x) = 1 −x B∗= 0 [300, 400] f(x) = −2x2 + 2x g(x) = 1 −x B∗= 0.5 [400, 500] f(x) = x2 + 1 2x g(x) = 1 −x B∗= 1 Table 1: The dynamics go to the respective equilibrium B∗ under some combinations of defense-power function f(x) and attack-power function g(x). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (a) Scenario I: B∗= 0 is stable, B∗= 1 is unstable. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (b) Scenario II: B∗= 0 is unsta- ble, B∗= 1 is stable. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (c) Scenario III: B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 are stable, B∗= 1 2 is unstable. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (d) Scenario IV: B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 are unstable, B∗= 1 2 is stable. Figure 2: Phase portraits of the four scenarios conﬁrming the stabilities of the equilibria, where x-axis represents time, and y-axis represents the portion of secure nodes ⟨Bv(t)⟩. Now we study the stability of the equilibria. For the GB = GR mentioned above, we consider the above four scenarios as high- lighted in Table 1. More speciﬁcally, for time t ∈[0, 150], the defense-power function is f(x) = x2 + x and the attack-power function is g(x) = 1 −x (i.e, the above Scenario I); for time t ∈[150, 300], the defense-power function is f(x) = x2 and the attack-power function is g(x) = 1 −x (i.e., the above Sce- nario II); for time t ∈[300, 400], the defense-power function is f(x) = −2x2 + 2x and the attack-power function is g(x) = 1 −x (i.e., the above Scenario IV); for time t ∈[400, 500], the defense- power function is f(x) = x2 + 1 2x and the attack-power function is g(x) = 1 −x (i.e., the above Scenario III). 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t Figure 3: Active cyber defense dynamics lack persistent equi- librium due to frequent perturbations. Figure 3 plots a very probable scenario that can happen to the portion of secure nodes, where three small perturbations are im- posed at t = 150, 300, 400. This scenario is very probable because it can explain why the cyber security state may rarely enter some persistent equilibrium. Speciﬁcally, the initial value Bv(0), v ∈V , is randomly chosen from interval (0, 0.01] by the uniform distribu- tion. At t = 150, we ﬁnd that ⟨Bv(150)⟩= 1. We then impose a small perturbation on each Bv(150), by replacing Bv(150) with Bv(150) −εv where εv is an independent random variable of a uniform distribution in the interval [0, 0.01] for all v ∈V . Simi- larly, we replace Bv(300) with Bv(300) + εv and Bv(400) with Bv(400) −εv for all v ∈V . Figure 3 illustrates that under small perturbations, the overall cyber security dynamics never enter any persistent equilibrium. This offers one possible explanation why real-life cyber security is perhaps never in any equilibrium. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (a) ν = 0.5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (b) ν = 0.8 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (c) ν = 0.85 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (d) ν = 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (e) ν = 1.5 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 〈Bv(t)〉 t (f) ν = 2 Figure 4: Phase portraits of the portion of secure nodes ⟨Bv(t)⟩: f(x, ν) = νx −2x2 and g(x) = (1 −2x)2. Example 2: Stability effect of parameterized defense-power func- tions vs. a ﬁxed attack-power function. Suppose GB = GR is an ER graph G = (V, E) with |V | = 2, 000, but with edge probability p = 0.5. We consider the following parameterized defense-power function f(x, ν) with parameter ν ∈(0, +∞) and ﬁxed attack- power function g(x): f(x, ν) = νx −2x2, g(x) = (1 −2x)2. Figure 4 plots the phase portraits of ⟨Bv(t)⟩with ν = 0.5, 0.8, 0.85, 1, 1.5, 2, respectively. The portraits can be classiﬁed into three classes. Figures 4(a)-4(b) show that there is one stable equi- librium B∗= 0. Figure 4(c) shows that there are three equilibria B∗= 0, 0.38, 0.2, where the ﬁrst two are stable but the last one is unstable. Figures 4(d)-4(f) show that there exist two equilibria B∗= 0, σ with σ > 0, where B∗= 0 is unstable and B∗= σ is stable. We observe that active cyber defense dynamics exhibit different phenomena with respect to different parameters. More- over, we observe a sort of phase transition in parameter ν: when ν ≤0.8, the global cyber security state converges to B∗= 0 al- most regardless of the initial value; when ν ≥1, the global cyber security state converges to some B∗= σ > 0 almost regardless of the initial value; when 0.8 < ν = 0.85 < 1, the global cyber security state converges to some equilibrium dependent upon the initial value. We summarize the discussion in this section into: INSIGHT 1. Active cyber defense dynamics may rarely enter into any equilibrium because of perturbations to the global secu- rity state as caused by the manual cleaning of some compromised computers (Figure 2), and/or because of perturbations to the at- tack/defense power function as caused by the introduction of a new attack/defense method (Figures 3-4 ) 4. TRANSITION BETWEEN MULTIPLE ATTRACTORS We are now ready to precisely characterize the transition be- tween the equilibria, which reﬂects the consequence/effect of the defender manipulating the initial global security state (e.g., man- ually cleaning up some compromised computers before launch- ing active defense) and/or manipulating the attack/defense network structure (e.g., by changing the network access control policy to block/allow certain computers to communicate with certain other computers). 4.1 Transition Between the All-blue and All-red Equilibria Under the conditions mentioned in Corollary 1, namely, f(0) = g(1) = 0, system (2) has two locally stable equilibria B∗= 1 and B∗= 0. Let B =  B1, B2, · · · , Bn  ∈[0, 1]n and R = 1−B =  1 −B1, 1 −B2, · · · , 1 −Bn  ∈[0, 1]n, where n = |V |. For τ ∗ 1 , τ ∗ 2 ∈(0, 1), we deﬁne two sets ΞGB,τ∗ 1 and ΞGR,τ∗ 2 as follows: ΞGB,τ∗ 1 = ( B ∈[0, 1]n 1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu ≥τ ∗ 1 , ∀v ∈V ) , (8) ΞGR,τ∗ 2 = ( R ∈[0, 1]n 1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Ru ≥τ ∗ 2 , ∀v ∈V ) . (9) The following Theorem 1, whose proof is deferred to the Ap- pendix, gives the transition between the all-blue and all-red equi- libria by manipulating the initial state B(0). THEOREM 1. Let GB = (V, EB) and GR = (V, ER) be two arbitrary graphs. Suppose that f(·) and g(·) are continuous with f(0) = g(1) = 0. Case 1: Suppose the attack-power and defense-power functions sat- isfy, ∀z ∈[τ ∗ 1 , 1) and ∀B ∈ΞGB,τ∗ 1 and some α > 0, f (z) > α · z, (10) f 1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu ! + g 1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu ! ≤ α (11) If initial value B(0) ∈ΞGB,τ∗ 1 , then lim t→∞Bv(t) = 1 ∀v ∈V . Case 2: Suppose the attack-power and defense-power functions sat- isfy, ∀z ∈[τ ∗ 2 , 1) and ∀R ∈ΞGR,τ∗ 2 and some β > 0, g (1 −z) > β · z and f 1 − 1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Ru ! + g 1 − 1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Ru ! ≤ β (12) If initial value R(0) ∈ΞGR,τ∗ 2 , then lim t→∞Rv(t) = 1 ∀v ∈V . The cyber security meaning of Theorem 1 is: Under a certain condition (case 1), the defender needs to manipulate the initial global security state B(0) to belong to ΞGB,τ∗ 1 to make active defense 1-effective; this says what the defender should strive to do. Under certain other circumstances (case 2), the defender should make sure that the initial global security state B(0) does not cause R(0) = 1 −B(0) ∈ΞGR,τ∗ 2 , because in this regime active defense is 0- effective; this says what the defender should strive to avoid. For the following two corollaries, we deﬁne ΞGB,τ∗=   B ∈[0, 1]n 1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu > τ ∗, ∀v ∈V   , ΘGR,τ∗=   B ∈[0, 1]n 1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu < τ ∗, ∀v ∈V   . On one hand, the following Corollary 3 says that when τ ∗ 1 = τ ∗ 2 = τ ∗, we obtain the same threshold for the transitions. COROLLARY 3. Suppose f(·) and g(·) are continuous with f(0) = g(1) = 0. There exist constants τ ∈(0, 1) and α > 0 such that the following two conditions hold: (i) The attack-power and the defense-power functions satisfy f (z) > α · z for any z ∈(τ ∗, 1), and for any B ∈ΞGB,τ∗ f   1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu  + g   1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu   ≤α. (ii) The attack-power and the defense-power functions satisfy g (z) > α(1 −z) for any z ∈(0, τ ∗), and for any B ∈ΘGR,τ∗ f   1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu  + g   1 deg(v, GR) X u∈Nv,GR Bu   ≤α. If initial value B(0) ∈ΞGB,τ∗, then lim t→∞Bv(t) = 1 ∀v ∈V ; if initial value B(0) ∈ΘGR,τ∗, then lim t→∞Bv(t) = 0 ∀v ∈V . On the other hand, the following Corollary 4 makes a connection to [36], by accommodating Theorems 1, 5, 8 and 9 in [36] as a special case with GB = GR and α = 1. COROLLARY 4. Suppose GB = GR = G = (V, E) and f(·), and g(·) are continuous with f(0) = g(1) = 1. There exist τ ∗∈ (0, 1) and α > 0 such that the attack-power and defense-power functions satisfy f (z) + g (z) ≤α ∀z ∈[0, 1] and the defense-power function satisfy f (z) > α · z ∀z ∈(τ ∗, 1) and f (z) < α · z ∀z ∈(0, τ ∗). If initial value B(0) ∈ΞG,τ∗, then lim t→∞Bv(t) = 1 for all v ∈V ; if initial value B(0) ∈ΘG,τ∗, then lim t→∞Bv(t) = 0 for all v ∈V . 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 τ*= 0.5 initial value x f (x) and g (x) g(x)=2(1−x)2 f(x)=(e−10x+5+1)−1 (a) f(x), g(x) and threshold τ ∗= 0.5 satisfy the condition of transition between B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 0 5 10 15 20 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Transition induced by initial values 〈Bv(t)〉 t (b) Transition induced by varying initial value ⟨Bv(0)⟩ Figure 5: Transition between equilibria B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 as induced by varying the initial value. 4.2 Example We consider the transition between equilibria B∗= 0 and B∗= 1 as caused by varying the initial value B(0). We use two concrete defense-power and attack-power functions: f(x) = 1 e−10x+5 + 1, g(x) = 2(1 −x)2, which are plotted in Figure 5(a). The graphs GB and GR are two ER graph instances with |V | = 2, 000 and p = 0.5. We consider the transition induced by varying the initial value ⟨Bv(0)⟩between 0 and 1. Figure 5(b) shows that when ⟨Bv(0)⟩> 0.5, the dynamics converge to B∗= 1; when ⟨Bv(0)⟩< 0.5, the dynamics converge to B∗= 0. The exploration in this section can be summarized as: INSIGHT 2. A small change in the initial global security state, in the model parameters, in the attack network structure, or in the defense network structure can lead to substantial change in active cyber defense dynamics. A rigorous characterization, such as The- orem 1, can offer precise guidance on “what the defender should strive to do” and “what the defender should strive to avoid” (e.g., how to manipulate the dynamics to beneﬁt the defender rather than the attacker). 5. HOPF BIFURCATION We consider Hopf bifurcation near equilibrium B∗= σ ∈(0, 1) under condition (1 −σ) · f(σ) = σ · g(σ). Recall that the stability of B∗= σ ∈(0, 1) depends on λ1(M), where M, as deﬁned in Eq. (3), is the Jacobian matrix of system (2). In the rest of the paper, we may simplify the notation λ1(M) as λ1 unless there is potential ambiguity. Consider differentiable defense-power and attack-power func- tions f(x, ν) and g(x, ν) with parameter ν. Suppose ∂f ∂ν , ∂g ∂ν and ∂M ∂ν all depend on ν. Consider the following critical condition for Hopf bifurcation: ℜ(λ1) = 0 and ℑ(λ1) ̸= 0. (13) It is known that if (13) holds for some ν = ν∗, λ1(ν) is differen- tiable in ν, and dλ1 dν ̸= 0 at ν = ν∗, then system (2) exhibits Hopf bifurcation [24]. Therefore, we need to ﬁnd the critical value ν∗. For this purpose, we adopt the approach described in [20] to inves- tigate how λ1 depends on the permutation to M, namely to conduct a perturbation spectral analysis to compute the perturbation to λ1, denoted by δλ1, as caused by perturbation to M, denoted by δM. 5.1 How to Estimate δλ1 Let x1 be the eigenvector of M associated to eigenvalue λ1, namely, Mx1 = λ1x1. For perturbation δM to M, M + δM can be described as M(ν) + M ′(ν)δν. The perturbation to M causes perturbation δλ1 to λ1 and perturbation δx1 to x1. That is,  M + δM  x1 + δx1  =  λ1 + δλ1  x1 + δx1  . By ignoring the second-order term, we obtain Mδx1 + δMx1 = λ1δx1 + δλ1x1. (14) By multiplying both sides of Eq. (14) with the left eigenvector y1 corresponding to λ1, we obtain y⊤ 1 Mδx1 + y⊤ 1 δMx1 = y⊤ 1 λ1δx1 + y⊤ 1 δλ1x1, y⊤ 1 λ1δx1 + y⊤ 1 δMx1 = y⊤ 1 λ1δx1 + y⊤ 1 δλ1x1, y⊤ 1 δMx1 = y⊤ 1 δλ1x1. As a result, we can estimate δλ1 as δλ1 = y⊤ 1 δMx1 y⊤ 1 x1 , (15) where δM can be estimated depending on whether the perturba- tion is to the attack and/or defense power (Case A below) or to the attack/defense network structure (Case B below). Case A: δM is caused by perturbation to attack- and/or defense power. Suppose the perturbation is imposed on parameter ν in the attack-power and defense-power functions f(x, ν) and g(x,ν), where ∂f ∂ν and ∂g ∂ν depend on ν as mentioned above. The cyber security meanings of such perturbations is (for example) that new attack and/or defense techniques are introduced. Note that δM(ν) = ( (1 −σ)∂f ′(σ, ν) ∂ν D−1 ABAB −σ ∂g′(σ, ν) ∂ν D−1 ARAR  − ∂f(σ, ν) ∂ν + ∂g(σ, ν) ∂ν  In ) δν. In the special case GB = GR = G (i.e., the adjacency matrix AB = AR = A), we have M =  (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ)  D−1 A A −  f(σ) + g(σ)  In, the eigenvalues of M are  (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ)  µ −  f(σ) + g(σ)  In for all µ ∈λ(D−1 A A), and the perturbation can be rewrit- ten as δM(ν) = ( (1 −σ)∂f ′(σ, ν) ∂ν −σ ∂g′(σ, ν) ∂ν  D−1 A A − ∂f(σ, ν) ∂ν + ∂g(σ, ν) ∂ν  In ) δν. Hence, (15) becomes δλ1 = y⊤ 1 h (1 −σ)∂f ′(σ, ν) ∂ν −σ ∂g′(σ, ν) ∂ν i D−1 A A − h∂f(σ, ν) ∂ν + ∂g(σ, ν) ∂ν i In  δν · x1 , y⊤ 1 x1. (16) Case B: δM is caused by perturbation to attack and/or de- fense network structure. Suppose the perturbation is imposed on GB = (V, EB) and/or GR = (V, ER) by adding/deleting edges. The cyber security meaning of such perturbations is that the net- work is disrupted (e.g., edges are deleted by the attacker, or security policies have changed) and then edges are added by the defender. We assume that the number of added/deleted edges is small (com- pared with |EB| and |ER|, respectively) so that we can approxi- mately treat δM as a small perturbation. Let CB = D−1 ABAB and CR = D−1 ARAR. Perturbations to AB and AR lead to AB + δAB and AR + δAR, respectively. Correspondingly, we obtain the per- turbations to CB and CR: δCB = D−1 AB+δAB(AB + δAB) −D−1 ABAB, δCR = D−1 AR+δAR(AR + δAR) −D−1 ARAR. Then, the perturbation to Jacobian matrix M is δM = (1 −σ)f ′(σ)δCB −σg′(σ)δCR. From (15), we have δλ1 = y⊤ 1 h (1 −σ)f ′(σ)δCB −σg′(σ)δCR i x1 y⊤ 1 x1 . Note that in the special case GB = GR = G (i.e., AB = AR = A) with perturbations δCB = δCR, we have δM = h (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) i δC, δλ1 = y⊤ 1 h (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ) i δCx1 y⊤ 1 x1 . 5.2 Example: Hopf Bifurcation Induced by Perturbation to Parameter In order to show that Hopf bifurcation can happen, we consider an ER graph GB = GR = G = (V, E) with |V | = 2, 000 and edge probability p = 0.005. Let µ1 denote the eigenvalue of D−1 A A with the smallest real part, where A is the adjacency matrix of G. For the ER graph, we have ℜ(µ1) = −0.3448. We consider the following defense-power and attack-power functions: f(x) = −4x2 + 4x, g(x, ν) =  νx −ν 2 2 , where f(x) does not depend on ν. Recall that under condition (1 −σ)f(σ) = σg(σ), there exists equilibrium B∗= σ ∈(0, 1). When ν = 3, we have homogeneous equilibrium B∗= 0.7, which is locally stable according to the second condition in the ﬁrst part of Corollary 2: (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ, 3) = −3 < 0, f(σ) + g(σ, 3) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ, 3) = −0.4 < ℜ(µ1) = −0.3448. When ν = 4, we have homogeneous equilibrium B∗= 0.6667, which is locally unstable according to the second condition in the second part of Corollary 2: (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ, 4) = −4 < 0 f(σ) + g(σ, 4) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ, 4) = −0.3333 > ℜ(µ1) = −0.3448. Therefore, there is a critical value between ν = 3 and ν = 4, at which ℜ(λ1(M)) = 0. By conducting 100 independent simulation runs of ν ∈[3, 4) with step-length 0.01, we ﬁnd the critical value ν = 3.8 and the corresponding equilibrium B∗= 0.6724, where (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ, 3.8) = 7 −3.81 < 0, f(σ) + g(σ, 3.8) (1 −σ)f ′(σ) −σg′(σ, 3.8) = −0.3448 = ℜ(µ1). Figure 6(a) plots the periodic trajectory of ⟨Bv(t)⟩when ν = 4 > 3.8, which surrounds equilibrium B∗= 0.6724. Figure 6(b) plots the periodic trajectory of ⟨Bv(t)⟩when ν = 5.05 > 3.8. Figure 6(c) plots the bifurcation diagram with respect to ν ∈ (3, 6). Figure 6(d) plots the bifurcation diagram with respect to ν ∈(4.75, 5.5). We observe that when ν ∈(5, 5.5), there are not only two-periodic trajectories, but also k-periodic trajectories (k > 2). In summary, the periodic trajectories exhibit the period- doubling cascade phenomenon. 5.3 Example: Hopf Bifurcation Induced by Perturbation to Attack/Defense Network Structures For the purpose of demonstrating the bifurcation phenomenon caused by perturbation to network structures, we use two randomly generated ER graph examples GB = (V, EB) and GR = (V, ER), both with |V | = 2, 000 and p = 0.005. The average degree is 10.0565 for GB and 11.1865 for GR. We use the following defense-power and attack-power functions: f(x) = −4x2 + 4x, g(x, ν) =  νx −ν 2 2 with ν = 6 We perform 100 iterations of operations to GR as follows: during each of the ﬁrst 50 iterations, we delete 226 edges (or 1% of the edges in the original ER) chosen independently and uniformly at random; during each of the following 50 iterations, we add 226 edges chosen independently and uniformly random among all the unconnected edges. That is, we delete and then add 50% edges of the original |ER|. Figure 7 demonstrates that the period-doubling cascade phe- nomenon appears and ﬁnally leads to chaos after deleting more than 36% edges and before adding 14% edges. We observe that eventually the diagram becomes stable after adding the same num- ber of edges as those deleted. (Note that Figure 7 is not symmetric because the added edges are random and in general are different from the edges that are deleted.) The following insight summarizes the exploration of this section. INSIGHT 3.

These situations are “unmanageable” because it would be infeasible, if not impossible, to estimate the global secu- rity state in real-time. Therefore, the defender must strive to avoid such unmanageable situations by manipulating the dynamics care- fully (e.g., by disrupting the bifurcation condition or containing the attack-power of the adversary). 6. CHAOS Figure 6(c) shows that the number of periodic points increase with parameter ν, which hints that system (2) can exhibit the chaos phenomenon. To see this, we consider the case GB = GR. In this case, system (2) becomes dBv(t) dt = f   1 deg(v, G) X u∈Nv,G Bu(t)   h 1 −Bv(t) i − g   1 deg(v, G) X u∈Nv,G Bu(t)  Bv(t). Let F  Bv(0), t  denote the right-hand part. Consider Bv(0) and Bv(0) + εv(0) for all v ∈V , where εv(0) ∈Rn is a small pertur- bation to the initial point Bv(0). Then, we have ∀v ∈V , εv(t) = F  Bv(0) + εv(0), t  −F  Bv(0), t  = DF  Bv(0), t  · εv(0), where DF  Bv(0), t  is the Jacobian matrix of the map F at time t. By the QR decomposition of matrix ε(t) = [ε1(t), ε2(t), · · · , εn(t)] where n = |V |, we obtain matrix ε(t) = q(t) · r(t), where q(t) is an orthogonal matrix and r(t) is an upper triangular matrix. Note that ε(t) = q(t) and the diagonal element λii(t) of rt at time t is the exponential magniﬁcation, where i ∈{1, 2, · · · , n}. Thus, the average rate of divergence or convergence of the two tra- jectories  F  Bv(0), t  t ≥0 and {F  Bv(0)+εv(0), t  t ≥0 for all v ∈V is deﬁned by Li = lim t→∞ 1 t ln λii(t), where Li for i = 1, 2, · · · , n are the Lyapunov characteristic ex- ponents. It is known [24] that under some mild conditions, the above limit exists and is ﬁnite for almost all initial values B(0) = [B1(0), B2(0), · · · , Bn(0)] and for almost all matrices ε(0). Note that MLE = max1≤i≤n Li indicates whether the dynamical sys- tem is chaotic or not. More speciﬁcally, when MLE > 0, a small perturbation to the initial value will lead to an exponential separa- tion and therefore leads to the chaos phenomenon. Example. Consider an ER graph instance GB = GR with |V | = 2, 000 and p = 0.005, and the following defense-power and attack- power functions: f(x) = −4x2 + 4x, gν(x) =  νx −ν 2 2 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 −0.04 −0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 ν Maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) (a) MLE with ν: MLE > 0 indicates chaos. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.588 0.59 0.592 0.594 0.596 0.598 0.6 0.602 0.604 〈Bv(t)〉 t (b) ⟨Bv(t)⟩for ν = 8 exhibits chaos. Figure 8: Active cyber defense dynamics exhibit the chaos phe- nomenon: GB = GR with |V | = 2, 000 and p = 0.005. Figure 8(a) plots the MLE with respect to ν. We observe that MLE > 0 when ν > 5, meaning that system (17) exhibit chaos for ν > 5. Figure 8(b) plots the phase portrait of ⟨Bv(t)⟩(i.e., the average of the Bv(t)’s for all v ∈V ) when ν = 8, which hints the emergence of chaos. This means that the defender should strive to avoid the parameter regime ν > 5. This leads to the following: INSIGHT 4. Active cyber defense dynamics can be chaotic, mean- ing that it is impossible to predict the global cyber security state because it is too sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated initial global security state. Therefore, the defender must strive to avoid such unmanageable situations (e.g., by disrupting the attacks to as- sure ν ≤5 in the above example). 7. RELATED WORK Cybersecurity Dynamics is a framework for modeling and quan- tifying cyber security from a holistic perspective (rather than mod- eling and analyzing security of components or building-blocks) [34, 35, 36, 17]. This framework builds on a large body of literature across Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistical Physics (cf. [7, 4, 33, 37, 38, 17, 39, 29, 6, 3, 28, 23, 11, 12] and the references therein), which can be further traced back to the century-old studies on biological epidemic models [19, 13, 8]. As a speciﬁc kind of cybersecurity dynamics, active cyber de- fense dynamics were ﬁrst rigorously modeled and studied in [36], despite that the idea of active defense has been discussed and de- bated for many years [14, 31, 18, 16, 26, 30, 1, 2]. We move a signiﬁcant step beyond [36], by separating the attack network structure from the defense network structure, and by considering more general attack and defense power functions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to show that bifurcation and chaos are relevant in the cyber security domain, and to discuss the cyber security implications of these phenomena. Following [36], Lu et al. [17] investigate optimal active defense strategies in the Control- Theoretic and Game-Theoretic frameworks. Our study is comple- mentary to [17] as we leave it to future work to investigate optimal strategies in our setting. It is worth mentioning that models of Lotka-Volterra type [9] capture the predator-prey dynamics, which are however different from the active cyber defense dynamics. Active cyber defense dy- namics may be seen as the non-linear generalization of the so- called Voter model in complex networks [25, 15]. Somewhat re- lated to our work is [5], which considers chaotic dynamics in discrete- time limited imitation contagion model on random networks. 8. CONCLUSION We have explored the rich phenomena that can be exhibited by active cyber defense dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to show that bifurcation and chaos are relevant in the cyber security domain. The implication is of high practical value: In order to make cyber security measurement and prediction feasible, the defender must manipulate the cyber security dynamics to avoid these unmanageable situations. Interesting problems for future research include: First, we need to characterize non-homogeneous equilibria as we only focused on homogeneous equilibria. Second, we need to characterize which graph structure is more advantageous to the other (e.g., GB is ER graph but GR is power-law graph). Third, we need to explore the chaos phenomenon further (e.g., multi-direction chaos). Fourth, we need to systematically validate the models. Acknowledgement.

APPENDIX Now we prove Theorem 1. PROOF. We prove the theorem in the ﬁrst statement with B(0) ∈ ΞGB,τ∗ 1 , and the second statement with R(0) ∈ΞGR,τ∗ 2 can be proved similarly. First, we see that g(1) = 0 implies that B∗= 1 is an equilibrium of (2) according to Proposition 1. Deﬁne Vt = argmin v∈V Bv(t) = n u Bu(t) = min v∈V Bv(t) o for t ≥0. Since the case minv Bv(0) = 1, namely Bv(t) = 1 for all v ∈V and t ≥0, is trivial, we assume minv Bv(0) < 1 without loss of any generality. For any v(0) ∈V0, the given condition (10) implies 1 deg(v(0),GB) P u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0) ≥τ ∗ 1 , and thus we have f   1 deg(v(0), GB) X u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0)   ≥ α · 1 deg(v(0), GB) X u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0), where “=” holds only when 1 deg(v(0),GB) P u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0) = 1. Let t = 0 and v = v(0). Using Eq. (2) and condition (11), we have dBv(0)(t) dt t=0 = f   1 deg(v(0), GB) X u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0)   h 1 −Bv(0)(0) i − g   1 deg(v(0), GB) X u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0)  Bv(0)(0) ≥ f   1 deg(v(0), GB) X u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0)  −αBv(0)(0) ≥ α  Bv(0)(0) −Bv(0)(0)  (17) = 0. Since the equality signs hold in the two inequalities in Eq. (17) only when minv Bv(0) = 1, which corresponds to the trivial case men- tioned above, we conclude that minv∈V Bv(t) strictly increases in a small time interval starting at t = 0 except for the trivial case. Let τ ∗∗ 1 > τ ∗ 1 such that 1 deg(v(0),GB) P u∈Nv(0),GB Bu(0) > τ ∗∗ 1 for all v ∈V . We now show that 1 deg(v,GB) P u∈Nv,GB Bu(t) > τ ∗∗ 1 for all t > 0 and for all v ∈V . Let t0 be the ﬁrst time that 1 deg(v,GB) P u∈Nv,GB Bu(t) = τ ∗∗ 1 for some v ∈V , i.e. t0 = inf   τ 1 deg(v, GB) X u∈Nv,GB Bu(t) > τ ∗∗ 1 ∀t ∈[0, τ), ∀v ∈V   . We show t0 = +∞. Suppose t0 < +∞. Let V ∗be the node set such that for each v ∈V ∗, 1 deg(v,GB) P u∈Nv,GB Bu(t) reaches τ ∗∗ 1 for the ﬁrst time. Then, for some v∗∈V ∗, we know that 1 deg(v∗,GB) P u∈Nv∗,GB Bu(t) is not increasing at t = t0. How- ever, it can be shown that d dt   1 deg(v∗, GB) X u∈Nv∗,GB Bu(t)   t=t0 = 1 deg(v∗, GB) X u∈Nv∗,GB dBu(t) dt t=t0 ≥ α deg(v∗, GB) · X u∈Nv∗,GB   1 deg(u, GB) X w∈Nu,GB Bw(t) −Bu(t0)   ≥ 0, where the equality signs hold only for the trivial case as in the case of Eq. (17) mentioned above (i.e., in all other cases the inequalities are strict). So we reach a contradiction, which means t0 = +∞. Owing to τ ∗∗ 1 > τ ∗ 1 , we have 1 deg(v,GB) P u∈Nv,GB Bu(t) > τ ∗ 1 for all t > 0. That is, B(t) ∈ΞGB,τ∗ 1 for all t. Let t1 be the maximum time that minv∈V Bv(t) is strictly in- creasing, i.e t1 = sup  t min v Bv(t) is strictly increasing in [0, t)  . We show that t1 = +∞. Suppose that t1 is ﬁnite, meaning that minv∈V Bv(t) is not increasing at time t = t1. Since it holds that minv∈V Bv(t1) > minv∈V Bv(0) > τ ∗ 1 , by replacing B(0) with B(t1), we have f   1 deg(v(t1), GB) X u∈Nv(t1),GB Bu(t1)   > α deg(v(t1), GB) X u∈Nv(t1),GB Bu(t1) and therefore we can show dBv(t1)(t) dt t=t1 ≥ f   1 deg(v(t1), GB) X u∈Nv(t1),GB Bu(t1)  −αBv(t1)(t1) ≥ α   1 deg(v(t1), GB) X u∈Nv(t1),GB Bu(t1) −Bv(t1)(t1)   ≥ 0, where are inequalities are strict except for the trivial case — as discussed in the case of Eq. (17). That is, minv∈V Bv(t) strictly increases at t = t1, which contradicts with the deﬁnition of t1. Therefore, we have t1 = +∞and minv∈V Bv(t) is strictly in- creasing in t ∈[0, +∞). In order to show limt→∞Bv(t) = 1 for all v ∈V , we will prove that limt→∞minv∈V Bv(t) = 1 for limt→∞minv∈V Bv(t) ≤ limt→∞Bv(t). Since Bv(t) is the probability that node v ∈V is blue at time t, we have 0 ≤Bv(t) ≤1 for all v ∈V . Hence limt→∞minv∈V Bv(t) exists. Suppose for the sake of contradic- tion that limt→∞minv∈V Bv(t) < 1, meaning minv∈V Bv(t) < 1 for all t due to its strict increasing monotonicity. For any v(t) ∈ Vt, under the condition that Eq. (10) holds, there exists ε > 0 such that f(Bv(t)(t)) −αBv(t)(t) > ε for all t. Since minv∈V Bv(t) is strictly increasing for t ∈[0, +∞), there exists T > 0 such that dBv(t)(t) dt = f   1 deg(v(t), GB) X u∈Nv(t),GB Bu(t)   h 1 −Bv(t)(t) i − g   1 deg(v(t), GB) X u∈Nv(t),GB Bu(t)  Bv(t)(t) ≥ f  Bv(t)(t)  −αBv(t)(t) > ε, for all t > T . This leads to Bv(t)(t) > Bv(T )(T ) + ε(t −T ). Since minv∈V Bv(t) = Bv(t)(t) →∞as t →∞, it contradicts with Bv(t) ≤1. Therefore, we conclude lim t→∞min v∈V Bv(t) = 1 and lim t→∞Bv(t) = 1.
