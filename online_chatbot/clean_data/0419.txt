This research thus aims to conduct a literature review focus- ing on non-technical issues in cyber security in the energy informat- ics field. The findings show that there are seven non-technical is- sues have been discussed in literature, including education, aware- ness, policy, standards, human, and risks, challenges, and solutions. These findings can be valuable for not only researchers, but also managers, policy makers, and educators. Keywords: energy informatics; cyber security; non-technical; literature review Findings This section presents non-technical issues that have been discussed in selected papers. Education. Literature discussed two main program types of educations on cyber security in energy informatics, that are training program for professional [4] (e.g., Skill gaps, workforce, team-taught, living lab), and training program for students [5] (e.g., Curriculum, course for STEM stu- dents, courses for undergraduate students). The curriculum for cyber security is discussed in three different levels that are equally important: Cyber security for all, cyber operations, and cyber-informed engineer- ing curriculum [6]. Moreover, pedagogical pillars for energy informat- ics cyber security education are active learning, project-based learning, Piaget’s learn-by-doing posture, and constructivism [7]. Awareness. Cyber security awareness is crucial for the effectiveness of organizational security [8]. Two types of awareness are often dis- cussed in those selected papers, including social awareness and situ- ation awareness. Social awareness helps enhance and improve cyber security in energy informatics. The awareness includes socio-economic consumer data; load disaggregation capability; end-use device data- base; and smart power hub [9]. Situation awareness indicates that architecture and tools are needed to help operators monitor and be aware of actual threats that exist between the network level and the business level [10]. Policy. There are two categories that have been discussed in those selected papers regarding policy (including legal, and regulatory), that are policy challenges and policy itself [11]. Policy challenges re- garding cyber security in energy informatics is one of the main con- cerns of scholars. Examples of those concerns include privacy, personal data, data security of sharing information in applications used by the smarter grid devices. Scholars also discuss unclear guid- ance on mandates and roles of organizations/countries on the topics of cyber security [12]. Geography. Majority selected articles come from the EU [13], North America [14], and Asia [15]. The NIST and the ISO frameworks/ standards are widely adopted by the EU Critical Infrastructure (e.g., ISO 27001 for IT security, or ISA 62443 for Operational Technology security). The European Union Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the USA provides security guidelines to support the implementation of high security standards for critical infrastructures. While the US and the EU’s scholars focus on solutions, it seems that Asian researchers are interested in threats, and needs for cyber security solutions (e.g., a need for a domain specific regulatory framework in India [15]). Standards. Standards (including frameworks and models) have been categorized into two types: Standards in general (e.g., Cyber security assessment [16]) and specific standards for a system (e.g., SCADA system cyber security standards [17]). Scholars discussed security assessment techniques [16], such as reviews passive, vulnerability identification, and vulnerability analysis (e.g., IEC 62351, IEC 62443, IEC 62056-5-3, ISO 15118, ISO/IEC 27019). Literature also discussed particular standards for a specific system, such as SCADA system [17]. Humans. Literature indicates that human behavior is considered one of the important factors in cyber security in energy informatics [18]. Two main issues of human factors have been discussed are roles of human failures in security, and cyber security leadership. For example, the security of smart technologies in the energy systems cannot rely only on technical solutions; humans play a significant role in failure in cyber security, whether it is intentional or unintentional [19]. Human aspects also include management (c.f., [20]). Solutions. Solutions for cyber security in energy informatic include issues related to risks [21], challenges [22], and solutions [23]. Risk topics include risk assessment of power information control systems [24], energy internet, digital secondary substations, renewable energy, smart grids, physical systems [25], and economic risk [26]. Challenges in smart grid include, for example, hyperphysical challenges in smart grid, information security and privacy challenges, technology challenges (AI, big data, IoT) [27], and communications [28]. Solutions include solution in general, solution in cyber security in smart grid, and solution in cyber security in physical system [29].and software. En- ergy systems thus do no longer rely on physical and local Introduction Energy transition is becoming an important trend nowadays. This trend brings cyber threats from information and communications technology (ICT) to the energy sector as ICT is embedded into energy systems. Although scholars have focused on cyber security to improve the cyber security of the energy system, the majority of literature focuses on technical aspects of cyber security. However, literature shows that technology is not enough in preventing cyber threats [1] as technical systems, the humans who operate them, and organizational contexts are all important [2]. Scholars thus call for a more holistic approach for effectiveness of security measures [1]. As a result, we conducted this study by focusing on non-technical issues in cyber security in energy informatics research. We particularly focus on the following research question: What are the main themes related to non-technical issues of cyber security in energy informatics? In this paper, aspects like awareness, policies, and organizational structures can be seen as non-technical aspects, while the specific technologies (e.g., firewalls, cyber-physical systems, algorithms) can be categorized as the technical aspects [3]. Methods To answer the research question, we conducted a systematic literature review in the field of cyber security in energy informatics. The search was carried out in March, 2022 by using the Scopus database. It is noted that IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library, which are largely Scopus-indexed. We focused on journals, conferences and book chapters with the following search string is used: ((“smart grid” OR “energy informatics”) AND ("cyber security" OR "cybersecurity" OR "cyber-security")) AND (LIMIT-TO (“journals” or “conferences” or “chapters”) AND (LIMIT-TO (LANGUAGE, “English”)). The result was 1151 papers with this search string. We then performed checking du- plicated or not-relevant papers. Next, we eliminated those survey and literature review papers, as well as omitted pure technical papers. Af- ter that, we read the remaining papers in full to eliminate those pa- pers that do not discuss issues related to the review’s scope. After this step, 211 papers were selected for review. Moreover, given that Energy Informatics journal is one of the main outlets in the field, we con- ducted a search on this journal. Two additional papers were found. It means that 213 papers were selected for this study. Energy Inform 2022, 5(Suppl 2):12 Page 9 Conclusion and Outlook We have retrieved seven non-technical issues on cyber security in energy informatics, they include education, awareness, policy, geography, standard, human, and solution. From these findings, it can be argued that security awareness is one of the important issues in cyber-defense. Energy system devices are gradually replaced by standard IT protocols and commercial-of-the-shelf hardware and software. Energy systems thus do no longer rely on physical and local measures for their operations. We thus suggest that more study in assessments of maturity cyber security awareness in organizations are needed, such as awareness models or frameworks in cyber security in energy informatics. Future research will focus on synthesizing these findings to benefit not only researchers, but also managers, policy makers, and educators. For example, identifying socio-technical gaps in the context of digital transformation [30] could help measures on preventing cybercrimes in a holistic way in cyber security in energy informatics.
