arXiv:2404.04725v1 [cs.CR] 6 Apr 2024 We need to aim at the top: Factors associated with cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers SIMON VRHOVEC, University of Maribor, Slovenia BLAŽ MARKELJ, University of Maribor, Slovenia Cyberattacks pose a signiﬁcant business risk to organizations. Although there is ample literature focusing on why people pose a major risk to organizational cybersecurity and how to deal with it, there is surprisingly little we know about cyber and information security decision-makers who are essentially the people in charge of setting up and maintaining organizational cybersecurity. In this paper, we study cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers, and investigate factors associated with it. We conducted an online survey among Slovenian cyber and information security decision-makers (푁= 283) to (1) determine whether their cybersecurity awareness is associated with adoption of antimalware solutions in their organizations, and (2) explore which organizational factors and personal characteristics are associated with their cybersecurity awareness. Our ﬁndings indicate that awareness of well-known threats and solutions seems to be quite low for individuals in decision-making roles. They also provide insights into which threats (e.g., DDoS attacks, botnets, industrial espionage, and phishing) and solutions (e.g., security operation center (SOC), advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities, organizational critical infrastructure access control, cen- tralized device management, multi-factor authentication, centralized management of software updates, and remote data deletion on lost or stolen devices) are cyber and information security decision-makers the least aware of. We uncovered that awareness of certain threats and solutions is positively associated with either adoption of advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities or adoption of SOC. Additionally, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant organizational factors (organizational role type) and personal characteristics (gender, age, experience with information security and experience with IT) related to cybersecurity awareness of cyber and informa- tion security decision-makers. Organization size and formal education were not signiﬁcant. These results oﬀer insights that can be leveraged in targeted cybersecurity training tailored to the needs of groups of cyber and information security decision-makers based on these key factors.

Decision-makers who are tasked with managing these cyber-risks need to deal with the challenges of evaluating risks in an evolving threat landscape and with constantly emerging new technologies [22, 28]. It is already challenging how to determine the real causes of cyber-incidents [10] which makes identifying the right countermeasures before incidents happen, taking into account their cost-beneﬁt relationships, an exceedingly diﬃcult task [14, 17]. Although a systematic approach to cybersecurity seems imperial, there are ideas about less measuring cybersecurity and more communicating about it [32]. For example, organizational leaders, such as Chief Information Oﬃcer (CIO), Chief Security Information Oﬃcer (CISO), and Chief Technology Oﬃcer (CTO), are at the core of supporting cybersecurity strategies by improving governance and integration as well as fostering a new cultural mindset for cyber-resiliency [18]. Nevertheless, decision- makers are primarily tasked with decisions on cybersecurity measures that can range from adopting cybersecurity Authors’ addresses: Simon Vrhovec, simon.vrhovec@um.si, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia; Blaž Markelj, blaz.markelj@um.si, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia. 1 2 Vrhovec and Markelj standards, technical measures, such as advanced antimalware [30] and intrusion detection [31] solutions, and human- centric measures, such as various types of cybersecurity training [12, 33], to inter-organizational measures, such as cyberthreat intelligence [9, 23, 25, 35]. The human aspect of cybersecurity is a thriving research area. Studies focus on social engineering and phishing [7], decision-making processes of SOC analysts [27], security concerns associated with adoption of social robots [38], eﬀects of cyberattack proximity [13], fake and real news decision-making [4], information seeking [36], testing cyber soldiers [16], replacing aging and thus insecure smart devices [15], etc. These are just a few examples which paint the diversity of these studies. The published literature however seldom focuses on decision-makers even though they are among the key enablers of cybersecurity in organizations. For example, Bongiovanni et al. (2022) [3] investigated how decision-makers implement measures recommended by published cybersecurity guidelines. A study on adoption of cybersecurity standards in SMEs found signiﬁcant factors, such as demographics (organization size, intensity of IT usage, number of IT staﬀ, number of IT security staﬀ, investments in IT, investments in IT security), attitudes towards organizational cybersecurity risks and customer cybersecurity needs [1]. Triplett (2022) [34] studied how cybersecurity is promoted by organizational leaders. Studies indicate that unintentional human factors which facilitate cyberattacks, include lack of support by leaders, lack of knowledge and skills, being not aware of severity and damage cyberattacks can have, complacency and naivety coupled with reluctance to learn or seek help, and cybersecurity fatigue [19]. Some studies indicate a lack of awareness and cybersecurity education by decision-makers [8, 26]. It is especially worrisome that decision-makers are often unaware of what solutions can do to protect data [26]. Formal education and organization size were found to be contributing factors [26]. Nevertheless, we found a single study that suggests cyberthreat awareness among decision-makers is high [20] albeit it remains unclear how the researchers came to this conclusion since they did not report it in their work. The ﬁndings found in the literature are thus mixed at best. The literature also does not provide any insights into which factors may be associated with cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers. These insights may would to improve the awareness of cyber and information security decision- makers, e.g., with targeted cybersecurity training tailored to the needs of groups of decision-makers based on these key factors. In this paper, we focus on cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers by investigating their awareness of well- known threats and solutions. First, we investigate whether there are diﬀerences between cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers in organizations adopting advanced antimalware solutions, and in organizations that do not. We break down advanced antimalware solutions into (1) advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities, and (2) security operation center (SOC) as two of the most common advanced antimalware solutions found on the market today. This enabled us to determine whether cybersecurity awareness might play an important role in their decisions on cybersecurity. Second, we explored which organizational factors and personal characteristics are associated with cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers. Based on this, we developed these research questions: RQ1: Are there diﬀerences in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers across groups based on adoption of antimalware solutions in their organizations? RQ2a: Are there diﬀerences in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers across groups based on organizational factors? RQ2b: Are there diﬀerences in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers across groups based on their personal characteristics? We need to aim at the top 3 This paper is structured as follows. We present the research methodology in Section 2. The results of our study are presented in Section 3. We provide theoretical and practical implications as well as limitations and directions for future work in Section 4. 2 METHODOLOGY 2.1 Research design We employed a cross-sectional research design to capture cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers and other vari- ables at a speciﬁc time period. We conducted a survey among cyber and information security decision-makers in Slovenian organizations through the CINT platform. We included IT/IS executive (e.g., CISO, CIO), non-IT/IS execu- tive (e.g., CEO, CFO) and non-executive (e.g., IT administrator, department head) decision-makers in the sample to cover the whole spectrum of cyber and information security decision-makers in organizations of diﬀerent sizes, and enable comparison between them. 2.2 Ethical considerations This study involved human participants. The study proposal was approved on 27 February 2023 by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Criminal Justice and Security at the University of Maribor [2702-2023]. 2.3 Measurement instrument The survey questionnaire was designed to measure awareness of threats, awareness of solutions, adopted antimalware solution type and adopted SOC realization in addition to organizational factors (organizational role type and organization size) and personal characteristics (gender, formal education, age, experience with information security and experience with IT). Awareness of threats included questions on nine common threats: loss of access to data (e.g., ransomware, locking of devices); information system intrusion (e.g., hacking); theft of business-critical data (industrial espionage); distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; takeover of devices (e.g., botnets); malware infection (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware); phishing; online fraud (e.g., CEO fraud, business email compromise); and internal threats (e.g., deliberate data deletion, unauthorized data access, unauthorized personal devices). Awareness of solutions included questions on 12 available solutions for managing cyber-risks: remote data deletion on lost or stolen devices; advanced antimalware solutions (with EDR/XDR capabilities); secure connection (e.g., VPN); cloud synchronization of data; data backup; centralized device management, including mobile device management (MDM); advanced ﬁrewalls (with IPS/IDS capa- bilities); training on secure use of devices; multi-factor authentication (e.g., 2FA); security operation center (SOC) 24/7; centralized management of software updates; and organizational critical infrastructure access control. Awareness of threats and awareness of solutions were measured on 4-point ordinal scales adapted from [6]: 1 – "I am very familiar with this [threat/solution] and what it is"; 2 – "I have heard about this [threat/solution] previously and am somewhat familiar with it"; 3 – "I have heard mention of this [threat/solution] before but am largely unfamiliar with it"; 4 – "I was not aware of this [threat/solution] before today". Respondents were ﬁrst shown a description of advanced antimalware solutions, including descriptions of EDR and XDR capabilities as well as SOC. Then, respondents were asked which types of antimalware solutions and SOC re- alizations were adopted in their respective organizations. Options for adopted antimalware solution type included an 4 Vrhovec and Markelj advanced antimalware solution with EDR/XDR capabilities, a standard antimalware solution, such as antivirus pro- grams, and none. Options for adopted SOC realization included a dedicated 24/7 security team within a respondent’s organization, an external SOC (SOC-as-a-service model), and none (incidents handled by IT or information security department). 2.4 Sample and data collection The survey was conducted in March 2023 through the CINT platform. We used organizational role as a screening question to ensure that all respondents were qualiﬁed to take the survey. A total of 356 respondents took the survey. After excluding unqualiﬁed respondents (21), responses with over 10 percent missing values (5), and responses that indicated non-engagement bias (47), we were left with 푁= 283 useful responses. Table 1 presents the key sample characteristics. Table 1. Sample characteristics.

Mean experience with IT was 10.4 years (푆퐷= 8.5), and mean experience with information security was 9.9 years (푆퐷= 8.1). Average employment duration was 10.4 years (푆퐷= 9.1). 2.5 Data analysis We used R version 4.3.3 with packages psych version 2.3.9, dplyr version 1.1.3, FSA version 0.9.5 and car version 3.1-2 for data analysis. We merged some categories and scores before data analysis. First, we merged categories for organiza- tional role into categories IT/IS executive (e.g., CISO, CIO), non-IT/IS executive (e.g., CEO, CFO) and non-executive (e.g., IT administrator, department head). This enabled us to test whether the organizational role type according to IT/IS back- ground and/or position within an organization is associated with cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers. Next, we merged scores for awareness of threats and awareness of solutions to improve the reliability of measuring these constructs. Measuring awareness with self-reported questionnaires is challenging as people do not tend to be very realistic about their own awareness of speciﬁc phenomena. We used a scale that adequately addresses this issue by describing four clearly distinct levels of awareness. We decided to further improve the reliability of the used scale by dividing respondents into those that are at least somewhat familiar with a threat/solution (aware) and those who are largely unfamiliar with it or heard about it for the ﬁrst time during the survey (not aware). A beneﬁcial side-eﬀect of We need to aim at the top 5 this mergence is an improved interpretability of the study results enabling the comparison of the awareness level of respondents in diﬀerent groups. Data analysis included non-parametric tests, such as Kruskal-Wallis test for determining diﬀerences between three or more groups with post-hoc Dunn’s tests with Bonferroni correction for determining diﬀerences between pairs of those groups. We used Wilcoxon tests to determine diﬀerences between two groups. We also used parametric tests when possible – we conducted independent samples 푡tests for determining diﬀerences in means across two groups. We used standard signiﬁcance levels (훼= 0.05, 훼= 0.01, and 훼= 0.001) for determining signiﬁcance of all statistical test results. 3 RESULTS In this section, we present the results relevant for answering the posed research questions. We analyzed the data related to cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers separately for all research questions. 3.1 RQ1: Are there diﬀerences in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers across groups based on adoption of antimalware solutions in their organizations? We analyzed cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers separately for two of the most common advanced antimalware solutions found on the market today: (1) advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities, and (2) security operation centers (SOC). Since the former is a technical solution, we compared it with other types of technical solutions (i.e., a standard antimalware solution and none). The latter is an organizational solution which can have varying realizations (i.e., internal SOC, external SOC, none). 3.1.1 Adopted antimalware solution type. Table 2 presents the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of threats for groups based on their organization’s adopted antimalware solution type. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of six threats. However, there were only four threats with clearly distinguishable diﬀerences between diﬀerent types of adopted antimalware solutions. For three of these threats (i.e., industrial espionage, botnets and phishing), there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between organizations that have either antimalware solution (EDR/XDR or standard) and those which do not. In all cases, respondents in the latter had a signiﬁcantly lower awareness of these threats. Awareness of DDoS attacks was however signiﬁcantly higher for respondents in organizations adopting ad- vanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities than respondents in those adopting a standard antimalware solution or not adopting any at all. Table 3 presents the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of solutions for groups based on their organization’s adopted antimalware solution type. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of 10 solutions. There were however just eight clear diﬀerences between diﬀerent types of adopted antimalware solutions. For six of these solutions (i.e., remote deletion, advanced ﬁrewalls, training, multi-factor authentication, SOC and centralized manage- ment of software updates), there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between respondents in organizations that have either antimalware solution (EDR/XDR or standard) and respondents in those which do not. In all cases, respondents in the latter had signiﬁcantly lower awareness of these solutions. For two solutions (i.e., advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities and centralized device management), there were clear diﬀerences among all three adopted antimalware solution type groups. In both cases, the most aware were respondents in organizations adopting advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities, followed by respondents in those which adopted a standard antimal- ware solution, while the least aware were respondents in organizations that did not adopt any antimalware solution. 6 Vrhovec and Markelj Table 2.

Notes: ∗푝< 0.05,∗∗푝< 0.01,∗∗∗푝< 0.001. These results indicate that awareness of certain threats and solutions is positively associated with adoption of anti- malware solutions. Decision-makers in organizations adopting an advanced antimalware solution with EDR/XDR ca- pabilities are more aware of one threat (i.e., DDoS attacks) and two solutions (i.e., advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities and centralized device management) than decision-makers in organizations adopting a standard antimalware solution. Additionally, they are more aware of four threats (i.e., industrial espionage, botnets, phishing and DDoS attacks) and eight solutions (i.e., remote deletion, advanced ﬁrewalls, training, multi-factor authentication, SOC, centralized management of software updates, advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities and centralized device management) than decision-makers in organizations which do not adopt any antimalware solution. Decision-makers in organizations adopting a standard antimalware solution are similarly more aware of three threats (i.e., industrial espionage, botnets and phishing) and eight solutions (i.e., remote deletion, advanced ﬁrewalls, training, multi-factor authentication, SOC, centralized management of software updates, advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities and centralized device management) than decision-makers in organizations which do not adopt any antimalware solution. 3.1.2 Adopted SOC realization. Table 4 presents the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of threats for groups based on adopted SOC realization in their organizations. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences in awareness of ﬁve threats. A single threat (i.e., online fraud) had clearly distinguishable diﬀerences between diﬀerent realizations of SOC. Respondents in organizations adopting an internal SOC were markedly more aware of this threat than respondents in organizations adopting an external SOC or not having a SOC.

The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences in awareness of ﬁve solutions, with clear diﬀerences between diﬀerent realizations of SOC for two of them. For both SOC and critical infrastructure access control, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between respondents in organizations that have either realization of SOC (internal or external) and respondents in those which do not. The latter had signiﬁcantly lower awareness of both solutions. These results suggest that awareness of certain threats and solutions is positively associated with adoption of SOC albeit this association does not seem to be as diverse as its association with adoption of antimalware solutions. Decision- makers in organizations adopting an internal SOC are more aware of one threat (i.e., online fraud) than decision-makers in organizations adopting an external SOC. There are no diﬀerences in their awareness of any solutions. Also, they are more aware of one threat (i.e., online fraud) than decision-makers in organizations which do not have a SOC. Decision-makers in organizations adopting either realization of SOC (i.e., internal or external SOC) are more aware of two solutions (i.e., SOC and critical infrastructure access control) than decision-makers in organizations which do not have a SOC. 8 Vrhovec and Markelj Table 4.

Table 6 presents the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of threats for groups based on their organizational role type. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of six threats. However, a single threat (i.e., industrial espionage) had clearly distinguishable diﬀerences between diﬀerent organizational role types. Non-IT/IS executive decision-makers were signiﬁcantly less aware of this threat than IT/IS executive and non- executive decision-makers. Table 7 presents the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of solutions for groups based on their organizational role type. The results suggest signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of all 12 solutions. Nevertheless, only six had clear diﬀer- ences between diﬀerent organizational role types. For four solutions (i.e., training, multi-factor authentication, central- ized management of software updates and critical infrastructure access control), non-IT/IS executive decision-makers were signiﬁcantly less aware of these solutions than IT/IS executive and non-executive decision-makers. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, non-executive decision-makers were signiﬁcantly more aware of remote data deletion and cloud synchro- nization of data than both IT/IS and non-IT/IS executive decision-makers. These results indicate some diﬀerences in decision-makers’ awareness of certain threats and solutions depending on their organizational role type. Non-IT/IS executive decision-makers are less aware of one threat (i.e., industrial espionage) and four solutions (i.e., training, multi-factor authentication, centralized management of software updates and critical infrastructure access control) than both IT/IS executive and non-executive decision-makers.

IT/IS executive decision-makers are additionally less aware of these two solutions than non-executive decision- makers. 3.2.2 Organization size. Table 8 shows the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of threats for groups based on orga- nization size. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of a single threat. Post-hoc tests did not reveal any organization sizes that would be clearly distinguishable from others. Table 9 presents the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of solutions for groups based on organization size. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of four solutions. Again, no organization size was clearly distin- guishable from others for any of these solutions. Based on the above, we can conclude that organization size is not associated with awareness of neither threats nor solutions. 10 Vrhovec and Markelj Table 6.

Table 10 shows the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of threats for groups based on their gender. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences in awareness of ﬁve threats. Male respondents were signiﬁcantly more aware of loss of access to data, industrial espionage, DDoS attacks, botnets and phishing than female respondents. Table 11 shows the diﬀerences in respondents’ awareness of solutions for groups based on their gender. The results indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences for awareness of six solutions. Male respondents were signiﬁcantly more aware of advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities, centralized device management, training, multi-factor authentication, centralized management of software updates and critical infrastructure access control than female respondents. These results suggest that male decision-makers are more aware of certain threats and solutions than their female counterparts. To be more speciﬁc, male decision-makers were more aware of ﬁve out of nine threats (55.6%), and six out of 12 solutions (50.0%). 3.3.2 Formal education.

Respondents who were aware of these solutions had signiﬁcantly more experience with IT than those who were not. These results indicate that decision-makers who are aware of two thirds of threats (66.7%) and solutions (66.7%) included in our study have more experience with IT than decision-makers who are not. 4 DISCUSSION In this section, we ﬁrst provide theoretical and practical implications of this study. Next, we discuss its limitations and put forward directions for future research. 4.1 Theoretical implications This study makes a number of theoretical contributions to the literature. First, awareness of well-known threats and solutions seems to be quite low for cyber and information security decision-makers. The results of this study indicate that about a third of decision-makers are not aware of DDoS attacks (35.1%) and botnets (32.4%), and about a quarter are not aware of industrial espionage (27.2%) and phishing (24.4%). This is especially surprising since these threats 14 Vrhovec and Markelj Table 10. Diﬀerences in awareness of threats across genders.

A quarter or more decision-makers are not aware of seven out of 12 solutions included in our study. More than a third of decision-makers were unaware of two of these solutions, namely SOC (38.4%) and advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities (36.2%), and a quarter or more decision-makers were unaware of further ﬁve solutions (i.e., organizational critical infrastructure access control (28.2%), centralized device management, including mobile device management (MDM) (26.7%), multi-factorauthentication (e.g., 2FA) (26.6%), centralized management of software updates (26.3%), remote data deletion on lost or stolen devices (25.0%)). Even though cyber and information security decision-makers are the primary enablers of cybersecurity in organizations, the results of our study suggest they are insuﬃciently aware of both threats and solutions. This lack of decision-makers’ cybersecurity awareness may signiﬁcantly impact their ability to make adequate decisions regarding cybersecurity, which is a challenging task to start with [17]. Additionally, this may hinder their ability to lead their organizations towards cyber-resilient culture [18, 34]. These ﬁndings are in line with most published literature (e.g., [8, 26]). This study makes a contribution to the literature on awareness of decision-makers by breaking down cybersecurity awareness into various kinds of threats and solutions. This break-down view shows that cybersecurity awareness may not be a monolithic construct thus future studies may incorporate its diﬀerent dimensions in their research designs. Second, this study suggests that there are diﬀerences in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers across groups based on adoption of antimalware solutions in their organizations. The results of our study indicate that awareness of certain but not all threats and solutions is positively associated with either adoption of antimalware solution types or We need to aim at the top 15 Table 11.

These ﬁndings contribute to the literature on awareness of decision-makers in organiza- tions adopting diﬀerent types of advanced antimalware solutions. We need to note that we did not search for causal relationships in our study. Therefore, it remains unclear whether higher awareness of decision-makers in organizations adopting advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities or organizations adopting either an internal or external SOC is the consequence of this adoption or vice versa. Future studies may thus focus on investigating this causal relationship. Third, the results of our study indicate that there are diﬀerences in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers across their organizational role types. Non-IT/IS executive decision makers had the least awareness which may be the consequence of their background, and appears to be in line with existing literature [29]. Next, non-executive decision-makers seem to be more aware of certain solutions than other decision-makers which may be a consequence of their more operational involvement in ensuring cybersecurity. This adds to the literature as one of the ﬁrst studies to investigate the importance of organizational role types. The results of our study however do not support the role of organizational size as suggested by published literature [3, 26]. The reason for this divergence could be found in 16 Vrhovec and Markelj Table 12. Diﬀerences in awareness of threats across formal education groups.

Future studies may focus on each type of organizational role type individually. Fourth, our study identiﬁes several personal characteristics of decision-makers associated with their cybersecurity awareness. Gender seems to be the most important demographic associated with cybersecurity awareness of decision- makers. Similarly to the published literature [29], male decision-makers were more aware than their female counter- parts. Age was also associated with cybersecurity awareness although for a much lower share of threats and solutions. Contrary to the published literature [26], formal education was not a signiﬁcant factor in cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers. Experience with IT was the most seminal personal characteristic associated with cybersecurity awareness of decision-makers, surpassing the share of signiﬁcant threats and solutions compared to experience with information security. Although this is somewhat surprising, the importance of IT has been emphasized in the litera- ture before [1]. These ﬁndings contribute to the literature on the relation between personal characteristics of decision- makers and their cybersecurity awareness. Future works may consider incorporating these characteristics in their research models. 4.2 Practical implications This paper provides some practical implications for increasing the ability to achieve higher levels of cyber-resilience in organizations. Since cyber and information security decision-makers are the main drivers and enablers of the cy- bersecurity mindset in organizations, understanding and improving their cybersecurity awareness has the potential to further improve the overall cybersecurity of organizations. First, this study provides insights into which threats We need to aim at the top 17 Table 13. Diﬀerences in awareness of solutions across formal education groups.

Second, the results of our study identify which decision-makers are more likely to be less aware of threats and solutions – i.e., especially decision-makers in organizations not adopting a malware solution, decision-makers in orga- nizations not adopting a SOC, non-IT/IS executive decision makers, female and younger decision-makers, and decision- makers with less experience with IT or information security. These characteristics can help to target the most needy decision-makers with cybersecurity awareness interventions. Detailed insights from this study may additionally help to adapt such interventions to the needs of a speciﬁc subgroup of decision-makers. We need to aim at the top 19 Table 18.

Since cultural contexts may be an important factor when studying cybersecurity awareness, the ﬁndings of this study may not be generalized to other cultural contexts. Future studies comparing our ﬁndings to or investigating the inﬂuence of diﬀerent cultural contexts would help to further generalize the ﬁndings of our study. Second, the question- naire included single items for measured constructs, such as dimensions of threats and solutions. This signiﬁcantly aﬀects the ability to check reliability and validity of the measurement instrument. Although we addressed this issue by merging scores for both awareness constructs, future studies may be needed to further conﬁrm our ﬁndings. Third, we are unsure whether there were cases of more than one respondent from a single organization since we did not ask respondents to name organizations in which they were employed. If there were several such cases, it may partially inﬂuence the results related to organizational factors, such as adopted antimalware solution type, adopted SOC realiza- tion, and organization size. Even though the possibility of this are relatively low, future studies would be beneﬁcial for conﬁrming the ﬁndings of our study. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work of SV and BM was partially funded by A1 Slovenia (https://www.a1.si/) as part of the Study on cybersecurity project, and by Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation of the Republic of Slovenia and the European Union’s NextGenerationEU 20 Vrhovec and Markelj initiative as part of the Green and Resilient Transition for a Safe and Successful Society project. The funders had no role in data analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. A1 Slovenia had a role in study design as they were included in narrowing down the list of potential threats and solutions compiled by the authors. The ﬁnal decision on the included threats and solution in the study rested with the authors. A1 Slovenia additionally had a role in data collection as a funder and an intermediary between the authors and the CINT platform. Other funders had no role in study design or data collection.
