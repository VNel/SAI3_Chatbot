Over the last years, the number of cyber-attacks on indus- trial control systems has been steadily increasing. Among several factors, proper software development plays a vital role in keeping these systems secure. To achieve secure software, developers need to be aware of secure coding guidelines and secure coding best practices. This work presents a platform geared towards software developers in the industry that aims to increase awareness of secure software development. The authors also introduce an interactive game component, a virtual coach, which im- plements a simple artiﬁcial intelligence engine based on the laddering technique for interviews. Through a survey, a preliminary evaluation of the implemented artifact with real-world players (from academia and industry) shows a positive acceptance of the developed platform. Fur- thermore, the players agree that the platform is adequate for training their secure coding skills. The impact of our work is to introduce a new automatic challenge evaluation method together with a virtual coach to improve existing cybersecurity awareness training programs. These training workshops can be easily held remotely or oﬀ-line.

These problems can result in serious consequences for the customer and the company that produced the software. This work aims to improve the situation through a serious game to raise awareness on secure coding and software development best practices of software developer – thus addressing the issues at early stages in software development, i.e., when it is being written. arXiv:2102.10430v1 [cs.SE] 20 Feb 2021 2 T. Gasiba et al. In the next sub-sections, we present the problem at hand in more detail. We give a brief overview of standardization bodies, industry-led eﬀorts, and academic eﬀorts that were started to address the current situation. Finally, we describe our proposed methodology and our contributions to scientiﬁc knowledge. 1.1 The Need for Secure Coding Awareness The number of security advisories issued per year by the Industrial Control System - Computer Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) has been steadily increasing. While before 2014 the number of advisories per year was less than 100, from 2017 to 2019 more than 200 advisories have been issued per year. These facts correlate well with the observed increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks to industrial control systems (ICS). The ransomware WannyCry, released by the ”The Shadow Brocker” hacker group in 2017, which exploits a vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, dubbed EternalBlue, has aﬀected numerous industrial control systems. It has caused a ﬁnancial impact exceeding 4 billion USD in more than 140 countries. The vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue is a buﬀer overﬂow caused by an integer overﬂow; exploitation of buﬀer overﬂows is not new - this is known since the late ’70s. While not everything (e.g., attacks and vulnerabilities) can be traced back directly to a speciﬁc software vulnerability, an increasing number of such vul- nerabilities (i.e., related with secure coding) have also been observed. Software security and secure software development play a fundamental role in industrial cybersecurity, particularly in critical infrastructures. According to a recent sur- vey with more than 4000 software developers [14], ”less than half of developers can spot security holes” [18]. This lack of awareness causes a severe issue in terms of cybersecurity of industrial control systems and critical infrastructures. The present work focuses on C and C++ programming languages. This is mo- tivated by a recent study by Whitehat [23], which has shown that C and C++ are among the most used programming languages for industrial environments, but they are also among the most vulnerable in terms of cybersecurity vulnera- bilities. This study also implies that the majority of vulnerabilities are created in these programming languages. 1.2 Standards, Industry, and Academic Eﬀorts In recognition of the importance of secure products and a consequence of the cur- rent move towards digitalization and higher connectivity, several large industrial players have joined together and committed to a document called the charter of trust [19]. The charter of trust outlines ten fundamental principles that the part- ners vow to obey to address the issues inherent with cybersecurity. ICS relevant standards such as IEC 62443-4-1 [12] or ISO 27001 [13] mandate the implementa- tion of secure software development life-cycle processes and awareness training. These standards address security from a high-level perspective and are not spe- ciﬁc enough about recommendations, policies, and best practices to be followed Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 3 in software development. Towards this goal, an industry-led eﬀort was created, the Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode), with the aim of identifying and promoting best practices for developing and delivering more secure and reliable software, hardware and services. Serious Games designed to train developers and raise their awareness for cybersecurity and secure coding is our approach to ameliorate the situation, and other approaches are [5, 6, 15, 16]. We designed a game to raise awareness for cybersecurity among programmers and for secure coding guidelines and secure coding best practices. Our approach is an adoption of the popular format of Capture-the-Flag. CTF is a serious game genre in the domain of cybersecurity popular in the penetration-test community as a means to practice oﬀensive skills. In this kind of game, the game participants aim to gather the highest amount of awarded by solving cybersecurity challenges, e.g., breaking into systems. In [6], Gasiba et al. study the requirements that a game designer should follow to target the game to software developers in the industry. In a further work [8], the authors provide six concrete and diﬀerent challenge types to be used in this kind of CTF event. One of these is the ”code entry” challenge type, where the proposed idea is that player interacts through a web interface with a backend by modifying vulnerable code until all the coding guidelines are fulﬁlled, thus solving the challenge. 1.3 Automatic Challenge Evaluation This paper extends the previous work, particularly the ”code entry” challenge type, by describing the architecture of a platform, which the authors call Sifu, that was constructed to implement the game backend. The goal of this platform is to: 1) automatically analyze the solution submitted by the participant to the backend, 2) determine if this solution contains vulnerabilities and fulﬁlls the required functionality, 3) generate hints to the player if the solution does not achieve a pre-determined goal and ﬁnally 4) provide a ﬂag (i.e., a unique code) which the player can use to gather points in the game. The correctness of the solution depends on it following established secure coding guidelines and secure programming best practices. The generated hints are provided by a virtual coach, which assists the player in solving the challenge. These hints are created using a simple artiﬁcial intel- ligence (AI) engine that provides automatic pre-programmed interactions with the player when the submitted solution fails to meet the secure coding criteria. These hints generated by the AI Engine (i.e., the virtual coach) assist the player in solving the challenge in a playful way and help lower the frustration, increase the fun, and improve the learning eﬀect during gameplay. The core of the present work is to describe the virtual coach platform. Nev- ertheless, to validate its suitability as a means to raise secure coding awareness, a small survey was performed with real players. Our preliminary results show that the participants have fun using the platform and also ﬁnd it adequate for learning secure coding guidelines and secure software development best practices. 4 T. Gasiba et al. 1.4 Contributions of this work This work seeks to provide the following impact in the research community: – introduce a novel method to automatically analyze player code submission in terms of secure coding guidelines and software development best practices, – introduce a virtual coach based on the laddering interview AI technique, and – provide a preliminary analysis of the suitability of the proposed architecture in terms of adequacy to raise secure coding awareness of software developers. Although we intend to use the Sifu platform in a CTF environment, it can also be used stand-alone in remote and oﬄine training scenarios. This can be especially important if the players are spread over a large geographic area or have inherent restrictions on a face-to-face workshop. 1.5 Paper Outline This work is organized as follows. In section 2 we present previous related sci- entiﬁc work. Section 3 presents details on the architecture and implementation of the Sifu platform. This section also introduces the virtual coach and gives details on the implemented artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm. In section 4, pre- liminary results from a short survey to 15 participants in a pilot are presented. Finally, section 5 presents the conclusions and further work. 2 Related Work Playing cybersecurity games is gaining more and more attention in the research community. In [5], Frey et al. show both the potential impact that playing cy- bersecurity games can have on the participants and also show the importance of playing games as means of cybersecurity awareness. They conclude that cy- bersecurity games can be useful to build a common understanding of security issues. A serious game [4] is a game that is designed with a primary goal and purpose other than entertainment. Typically these games are developed to address a speciﬁc need such as learning or improving a skill. A Capture-the-Flag (CTF) game is one possible instance of a serious game. Votipka et al. [22] argue in their work that CTF events can be used as a means to improve security software development. In particular, their work shows that the participants of such events experience positive eﬀects on improving their security mindset. Davis et al., in [2], discuss the beneﬁts of CTF for software developers. In their work, they argue that CTFs can be used to teach computer security and conclude that playing CTFs is a fun and engaging activity. In their work, Graziotin et al. [9] argue that happy developers are better coders. They show that developers that are happy at work tend to be more fo- cused, adhering to software development processes, and following best practices. This improvement in software development leads to the conclusion that happy Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 5 developers can produce higher quality and more secure code than unhappy de- velopers. The authors believe that CTF events since they are experienced as fun events, can foster higher code quality and adherence to secure development principles. However, CTF events need to be properly designed to achieve this goal. Gasiba et al., in [6], perform requirements elicitation employing systematic lit- erature review, interview of security experts, and also CTF participants from industry. Their work details the requirements for CTF events to raise secure coding awareness of software developers in the industry. In particular, they con- clude that CTF challenges for software developers should focus on the defensive perspective instead of oﬀensive. In their work, Sim˜oes et. al [20] present several programming exercises for teaching software programming in academia. Their design includes nine exercises that can be presented to students to foster student motivation and engagement in academic classes and increase learning outcomes. Their approach uses gamiﬁ- cation and automatic assessment tools. However, their work focus on the correct solution (implementation) of the programming exercise and not on the secure programming and security best practices aspects. Gasiba et. al [8] propose, in a similar work, six diﬀerent challenge types. These challenges, which are also a form of programming exercises, are executed in the context of a serious game of the type CTF and target software developers in the industry. One of the challenge types is a so-called code-entry challenge, where the CTF participant is given a project (e.g., in C or C++) that contains software vulnerabilities. The challenge aims to have the participants ﬁx the security vul- nerabilities by applying secure coding guidelines and software development best practices. In this previous work, the challenge type was only derived conceptually and lacked implementation and practical evaluation aspects. Vasconcelos et. al [21] have recently shown a method to evaluate program- ming challenges automatically. In their work, the authors use Haskell and the QuickCheck library to perform automated functional unit tests of challenges submitted by students. Their goal is to evaluate if the solutions presented by the students comply with the programming challenge in terms of desired func- tionality. One of the main limitations of this work is that the code to be tested should be free from side eﬀects. The authors also focus on functional testing of single functions and do not address the topic of cybersecurity. In [1, 3], Dobrovsky et al. describe an interactive reinforcement learning framework for serious games with complex environments where a non-player character is modeled using human guidance. They argue that interactive rein- forcement learning can be used to improve learning and the quality of learning. However, their work aims to train an algorithm better to recreate human behav- ior by means of machine learning techniques. In our work, we aim at training humans to write better and more secure code. Due to this fact, machine learn- ing techniques are not applicable. Nonetheless, we draw inspiration from the conceptual framework, which we adapt to our scenario. 6 T. Gasiba et al. Rietz et al. [17], show how to apply the principles of the laddering interview technique for requirements elicitation. The laddering technique consists of issu- ing a series of questions that are based on previous system states (i.e., previous answers and previous questions). The questions generated are reﬁned versions of previously issued questions as if the participant is climbing up a ladder con- taining more speciﬁc questions. Although this previous work applies in the ﬁeld of requirements elicitation and does not focus on cybersecurity, the laddering technique principle can be adapted to a step-wise hint system. In the present work, we also make use of the concept of awareness or IT- security awareness as deﬁned by Haensch et al. in [11], in order to evaluate our artifact. In their work, they deﬁne awareness as having the following three dimen- sions: perception, protection, and behavior. The perception dimension is related to the knowledge of existing software vulnerabilities. The protection dimension is related to knowing the existing mechanisms (best practices) that avoid soft- ware vulnerabilities. Finally, the behavior dimension relates to the knowledge and intention to write secure code. We collect data from participants based on the three dimensions of awareness through a small survey. We use best practices in the design, collection, and processing of survey information given by Grooves et al. [10]. 3 Sifu Platform In following sub-sections we present the research problem in terms of research questions and present a possible solution. Additionally, we describe the setup of a small survey that was performed to evaluate our result. 3.1 Problem Statement In [8], the authors present a type of challenge for CTFs in the industry, which is called code-entry challenge (CEC). The main idea of this type of challenge is for the Player to be given a software development project that contains code that does not follow secure coding guidelines (SCG) and secure software development best practices (BP) and contains security vulnerabilities. In this work, we target speciﬁcally ICS by using SCG and BP, which are speciﬁc for this ﬁeld. The task of the Player is to ﬁx the vulnerabilities and to follow SCG and BP. The Player should do this so that the original intended functionality is still fulﬁlled in the new version of the code. The present work aims to solve these requirements by means of a platform that performs an automatic evaluation of the code sub- mitted by the participant and guides the participant towards the ﬁnal solution. Considering these requirements, the following research questions are then raised: RQ1: how to automatically assess the challenges in terms of SCG and BP? RQ2: how to aid the software developer when solving the challenges? This work proposes to address RQ1 through a specialized architecture to au- tomatically assess the level of compliance to SCG and BP by combining several Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 7 state-of-the-art security testing frameworks, namely Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Runtime Application Security Protection (RASP). The functional correctness of the pro- vided solution by the Player is evaluated using state-of-the-art Unit Testing (UT). To address RQ2, the authors propose to combine the output of the secu- rity testing tools with an AI algorithm to generate hints based on the laddering technique, thus implementing a virtual coach. The task of the virtual coach is to lower the frustration of the participant during gameplay and to aid in the participant to improve the code. The proposed solution herein described makes a contribution towards an- swering these research questions. To validate the assumption of the suitability of our proposal as a means to address the research questions, a small survey was conducted. 3.2 Code-entry challenge platform architecture Figure 1 shows the top-level view of the Sifu architecture. In this ﬁgure, the ”Player” represents the game participant (a human) and the ”Project” repre- sents a software project that contains vulnerabilities to be ﬁxed by the Player. The ”Analysis & Hints” (AH) component performs the core functionality: 1) evaluates the submitted code (Project) in terms SCG and BP, 2) indicates if the challenge is solved or not and, if not solved, 3) generates hints to send back to the participant. The ”State” component stores previous interactions and generated hints. During gameplay, the Player reads the Project and modiﬁes the code by interacting with a web editor interface. When the changes in the code are done, the Player submits the code to the AH component for analysis. 3URMHFW $QDO\VLV +LQWV 3OD\HU 6WDWH 3OD\HULQWHUDFWV 6Q 6Q 3Q +Q Fig. 1. Conceptual game overview: interaction and components A possible realization of the conceptual architecture is shown in ﬁgure 2. Interaction takes place between the Player and a web interface, which connects to a web backend. The web backend is responsible for triggering the automated security assessment, collecting the answer from the AI engine, and sending the answer back to the participant. To realize this, the Project submitted by the 8 T. Gasiba et al. participant is ﬁrst saved into a temporary folder after a pre-processing step (e.g. to inject code necessary for unit tests). After the addition of auxiliary ﬁles (e.g. C/C++ include ﬁles) to the temporary project directory, the Project is compiled, and a functional test and security assessment is performed. All these results are then made available to an AI engine, which determines if the challenge is solved and generates hints. This feedback is collected by the web backend and stored in an internal database and forwarded as the answer back to the participant’s web browser. Web Backend Web Frontend Sandbox Tools SAST Unit Tests A.I. Collector Feedback Backend Project Pre- Processing AI Engine DAST Compiler ?/.6 Fig. 2. Detailed architecture: the Sifu Platform Automatic Security Assessment The security assessment which is per- formed to the Project is composed of the following steps: 1) Compilation, 2) Static Application Security Testing, 3) Unit Testing, 4) Dynamic Application Security Testing, and 5) Runtime Application Security Testing. In step 1, the Project is compiled; if there are compilation errors, these are reported to the AI component, and no further analysis takes place. Step 2 performs static code analysis. Note that in this step, the code does not need to be executed. Since the steps 3, 4 and 5 involve executing untrusted (and potentially dangerous) code, these are performed in a time-limited sandbox. The sandbox is very restrictive, e.g., it only contains the project executable and drops security-relevant capa- bilities (e.g., debugging and network connections are not allowed). Additionally, the executable is only allowed to run for a certain amount of time inside the sandbox. If this time is exceeded, the process will be automatically terminated. This avoids denial-of-service attacks by means of high CPU usage. Two types of Unit tests are executed: 1) functional testing - in order to guarantee that the provided code is working as intended (e.g., in the challenge description), and 2) security testing - in order to guarantee that typical vulnerabilities are not present in the code (e.g., buﬀer overﬂow). Security testing is done using self-developed Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 9 tests and also using state-of-the-art fuzzing tools. Steps 4 and 5 perform several dynamic security tests. Table 1 lists the tools that the authors have used in each of these components. In this table, the open-source components used in the Sifu platform are marked with ”OS”. Table 1. Security Assessment Tools Component Tools Compiler GCC v10.1 (OS), Clang 9.0.0 (OS) SAST SonarQube, Pc Lint, cppchecker (OS), fbinfer (OS), semgrep (OS) DAST Valgrind (OS), Helgrind (OS) RASP Address Sanitizer (OS), Leak Sanitizer (OS), Thread Sanitizer (OS) Unit Test ATF (OS), Kyua (OS), AFL (OS) Virtual Coach with AI Technique The AI component shown in ﬁgure 2 collects the results of the previous analysis steps, runs an AI engine based on the laddering technique, and generates the feedback to be sent back to the par- ticipant. Figure 3 shows the implementation of the AI engine using the laddering technique. As previously detailed, the automated assessment tools perform several tests that are used to determine the existing software vulnerabilities present in the Project. These are collected in textual form (e.g., JSON and XML) and nor- malized to be processed by the AI engine. The two most essential test results from the security assessment components are related to compilation errors (e.g., syntax errors) and functional unit testing. The participant’s solution will be re- jected if the code does not compile or is not working (functioning) as intended. When both these tests pass, the artiﬁcial engine uses the security tests, SAST, DAST, and RASP tools to generate hints to send to the participant. A combination of ﬁndings from these tools forms a vulnerability. These ﬁnd- ings and vulnerabilities are then mapped to SCG and BP. In ﬁgure 3, each horizontal path (ith row) corresponds to a ladder and also to a speciﬁc combina- tion of vulnerabilities or static events found in the source code. Each path is also assigned a priority p(i) based on the criticality of the SCG and vulnerabilities. These priorities are assigned according to the ranking of secure coding guidelines, as presented in Gasiba et al. (see [7]). Higher-ranked secure coding guidelines are given higher priorities, and lower-ranked secure coding guidelines are given lower priorities. The AI engine to selects the corresponding path (corresponding to one ladder) which based on the ﬁnding with the highest rank. The chosen hint Hn+1 depends on the ladder and on the previous hint level sent to the participant on the ladder, as given by the system state. If there are no more hints in the ladder, no additional hint is sent to the Player. Table 2 shows an example of hints provided by the virtual coach’s AI en- gine corresponding to an ”undeﬁned behavior” path. The lower level hints are generic and give background information for the participant. The highest level 10 T. Gasiba et al.

Finally, the Feedback component formats and enriches the selected hint by the AI Engine with project-speciﬁc information and sends it to the Web Back- End component to present to the Player. To foster critical thinking, the authors have also implemented a hint back-oﬀ(i.e., no hint will be given to the Player who is brute-forcing the hint system). This back-oﬀsystem implements the following rule: 1) no hint is provided to the Player during 4 minutes after the backend has sent a hint to the Player, and 2) no hint is given until the number of code submissions since the previous hint sent to the Player by the backend is equal to 3 submissions. Note that the feedback component not only fosters critical thinking by the Player, but can also be used to train the Player with the usage of static code analysis tools. However, further investigation of this aspect is needed in the future. Real-World Artifact Figure 4 shows the web interface of a real-world im- plementation of the Sifu platform. The machine where the Sifu platform was deployed was an AWS instance of type T3.Medium (2 CPUs with 4Gb RAM and network connection up to 5Gb/s). In order to install the required tools, a Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 11 hard-disk of 40Gb was selected. The Sifu platform itself is developed in Python 3.8 using Flask. Fig. 4. Sifu Web Interface On the left, the Player can browse the Project and select a ﬁle to edit; the ﬁle editor is in the center, and on the right are the hints that the Player receives from the backend. The upper part contains buttons which include the following functionality: Submit - to submit the Project for analysis, Reload - to reload the Project from scratch, Report Challenge - to report problems with the challenge to the developers. Note that, when a player ﬁnishes a challenge successfully, it is taken to an additional page with discussions on the impact of the vulnerability and additional closing questions (e.g., on which secure coding guidelines have not been taken into consideration). Evaluation of real-world artifact The platform containing ﬁve diﬀerent chal- lenges was made available for experimentation to 15 participants in Germany in June 2020. Participants’ ages ranged between 20 and 50 years old, with an av- erage of 28.3. The participants’ background was: 7 computer science students, 7 professional software developers, and 1 assistant professor. Participants were al- lowed to try the platform for as long as they liked; this resulted in a range from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. When successfully solving a challenge, the partici- pants were asked (through the web interface) to rate the challenge based on the questions presented in table 3. Additionally, upon completing the experiment, when the participants were asked to ﬁll out a small online survey. The questions asked in this survey are presented in table 4. Both the challenge rating and the platform survey questions were based on a 5-point Likert scale. 12 T. Gasiba et al. Table 3.

The results were processed using RStudio version 1.2.5019. Additionally, we brieﬂy discuss the threats to validity. 4.1 Challenge Feedback Figure 5 shows the results of the challenge rating questions. The average values and standard deviation are the following: Q3 3.92 (σ = 1.19), Q1 3.76 (σ = 1.30), Q2 3.72 (σ = 1.21). In order of agreement: the participants are conﬁdent to be able to ﬁx the problem in production code, have rated positively the presented challenges and would be able to recognize the vulnerability in (production) code. 2 1 3 0 3 1 6 7 3 7 5 10 10 9 8 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Q1 Q2 Q3 1 2 3 4 5 Strongly Disagree Strongly Agree Fig. 5. Evaluation of Challenges in Sifu Platform Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 13 4.2 Sifu Survey Figure 4 shows the survey results. The average values and standard deviation are the following: F6 4.33 (σ = 0.49), F2 4.00 (σ = 0.38), F9 3.93 (σ = 1.03), F7 3.80 (σ = 0.86), F8 3.80 (σ = 0.94), F1 3.73 (σ = 0.70), F3 3.67 (σ = 0.62), F5 3.67 (σ = 1.35), and F4 3.33 (σ = 0.82). In general, the overall positive feedback gathered through the survey shows that the Sifu platform helps to raise aware- ness on software developers on the topic of secure coding and secure software development best practices. In particular, the Sifu platform helps software devel- opers to practice secure coding guidelines (F6) and helps software developers to improve their secure coding skills (F2). Furthermore, using the platform is fun and adequate as a means to raise secure coding awareness (F9 and F7). In terms of awareness (perception - F3, protection - F2, and behavior - F6), as deﬁned by H¨ansch et al. [11], the platform is also seen as adequate to improve awareness. Another important aspect is that the participants ﬁnd that the programming examples are clearly presented in the platform (F8). Finally, the participants also tend to agree that using the platform can be fun (F9) and improve happi- ness (F5) and is an overall positive experience (F1). The results can be split into three clusters, according to the level of agreement as follows: medium agreement (3.33-3.67), higher agreement (3.73-3.8) and highest agreement (3.80-4.33). Using these clusters, the results can be interpreted in the following way (from highest agreement to medium agreement): – highest agreement: helps to practice and improve secure coding, is fun and adequate to raise secure coding awareness – higher agreement: challenges are clearly presented and the experience is pos- itive – medium agreement: helps to recognize vulnerable code and understand con- sequences and makes happy 2 0 1 3 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 3 4 4 0 1 2 2 13 13 11 8 4 10 10 8 6 0 1 0 0 5 5 2 3 5 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 1 2 3 4 5 Strongly Disagree Strongly Agree Fig. 6. Survey Results The results hereby presented give an indication towards the suitability of the herein proposed solution to address RQ1 and RQ2, as stated in the problem statement of section 3. 14 T. Gasiba et al. 4.3 Threats to Validity The main aim of this work is to present an architecture of a serious game geared towards improving the secure coding skills of software developers. To validate the platform’s usefulness, the authors have gathered feedback from 15 participants in a trial experiment. Possible sources of threat to the validity of the results and conclusions presented in the previous section include: – low number of participants: although the gathered feedback shows a clear tendency towards positive feedback, the number of participants was low, making the standard deviations relatively high, – participants’ background: while the serious game is designed for industrial environments, a large portion of the participants were computer science stu- dents. Although the authors do not believe that this causes a signiﬁcant change in the results, further studies with industry players is required, – survey design: the survey administered at the end of the experiment was guided by survey best practices; however, it lacks a formal and thorough design, e.g., based on existing theories and existing questions database, – external validity: although the goal of the present work is to propose a new method to raise secure coding awareness of software developers, our study did not contain a comparison of the methodology against existing and established methods. 5 Conclusions Secure coding guidelines, secure software development best practices, and se- cure coding policies form an essential aspect of secure software development for industrial control and cybersystems. Motivated by cybersecurity standards and industry needs on raising awareness about secure coding guidelines, this work presents a novel method where software developers learn these secure cod- ing best practices in an online environment in the context of a serious game - Capture-the-Flag, while being assisted through a virtual coach. In particular, this work addresses and details an architecture that can scale (e.g., through online training) and is based on an interview laddering technique to generate helpful hints. Another source of inspiration for the current work is reinforcement learning techniques; however, the trainee is a human being, not a machine. Our proposed solution uses existing open source components to perform unit- testing, static, dynamic, and run-time security analyses of the project code, which the participants need to change to eliminate software vulnerabilities. We also brieﬂy discuss implemented mechanisms that prevent cheating by the players and mechanisms that do not allow them to attack the system back-end. Finally, we obtain feedback on the produced artifact through evaluation ques- tions upon completing diﬀerent challenges and a small survey at the end of the experiment. Preliminary results show that the participants have fun using the platform and ﬁnd it an adequate means to raise awareness on secure coding best Cybersecurity Awareness with Virtual Coach and Automated Assessment 15 practices. The developed platform will be made available in the future, after the internal software clearing process. In future work, the authors would like to investigate additional factors that lead software developers to understand better the consequences of exploiting vulnerable code. Furthermore, the authors would like to investigate additional means to implement a more robust artiﬁcial engine for the virtual coach through systematic literature research. Furthermore, in a future publication, the authors will perform a large-scale comparative study with existing and established cy- bersecurity teaching methods. Finally, the quality of the virtual coach engine depends heavily on the quality and number of input sources. In this aspect, the authors intend to investigate further possible sources and the quality (e.g., false positive, false negative) of the existing and future input sources.
