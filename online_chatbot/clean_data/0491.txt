SCVI: Bridging Social and Cyber Dimensions for Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment Shutonu Mitra Virginia Tech Tomas Neguyen Virginia Tech Qi Zhang Virginia Tech Hyungmin Kim Virginia Tech Hossein Salemi George Mason University Chen-Wei Chang Virginia Tech Fengxiu Zhang George Mason University Michin Hong Indiana University Chang-Tien Lu Virginia Tech Hemant Purohit George Mason University Jin-Hee Cho Virginia Tech Abstract The rise of cyber threats on social media platforms neces- sitates advanced metrics to assess and mitigate social cyber vulnerabilities. This paper presents the Social Cyber Vulnera- bility Index (SCVI), a novel framework integrating individual- level factors (e.g., awareness, behavioral traits, psychological attributes) and attack-level characteristics (e.g., frequency, consequence, sophistication) for comprehensive socio-cyber vulnerability assessment. SCVI is validated using survey data (iPoll) and textual data (Reddit scam reports), demonstrating adaptability across modalities while revealing demographic disparities and regional vulnerabilities. Comparative analyses with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) show SCVI’s superior ability to capture nuanced socio-technical risks. Monte Carlo- based weight variability analysis confirms SCVI’s robustness and highlights its utility in identifying high-risk groups. By addressing gaps in traditional metrics, SCVI offers action- able insights for policymakers and practitioners, advancing inclusive strategies to mitigate emerging threats such as AI- powered phishing and deepfake scams. 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation & Goal The increasing digital engagement of people on social me- dia platforms has heightened their exposure to various cyber threats. Many individuals lack the digital literacy needed to recognize and mitigate these threats, making them prime tar- gets for cybercriminals. The consequences of scams, phishing, and other cyberattacks are severe, resulting in substantial fi- nancial loss, emotional distress, and diminished trust in online services. Although the Common Vulnerability Scoring Sys- tem (CVSS) remains a widely adopted standard for assessing technical vulnerabilities in systems and networks [6], no prior work has introduced a dedicated index to capture social cy- ber vulnerabilities affecting targeted populations. Similarly, while the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) identifies commu- nity vulnerabilities using socio-economic factors, it overlooks cyber-specific risks [15]. This work addresses these gaps by developing the Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI), a novel framework integrating individual-level characteristics and attack-specific threats, offering a specialized metric to inform policymakers and social media platforms about the vulnerabilities of high-risk demographics. The importance of this work becomes evident in its effort to bridge the divide between social and technical vulnerabil- ities. SCVI leverages insights from studies highlighting the influence of behavioral, psychological, and sociodemographic factors on vulnerability [16, 27]. Unlike traditional metrics such as CVSS or the socio-technical Cyber Risk Index [7], SCVI emphasizes nuanced dimensions of human suscepti- bility, incorporating elements like psychological traits (e.g., impulsivity, credulity), past experiences with scams, and the sophistication of attack techniques. By integrating these di- verse dimensions, SCVI enables a comprehensive evaluation of vulnerabilities across multiple contexts. The methodological complexity of visualizing social cy- ber vulnerabilities further underscores the need for SCVI. Behavioral, social, and psychological factors are inherently multi-dimensional and context-dependent [25, 41]. Design- ing an index synthesizing these elements requires sophisti- cated analytical approaches, including sensitivity analyses and multi-dimensional visualizations. For instance, Alim et al. [3] proposed metrics such as Individual Vulnerability (VI) and Relative Vulnerability (VR) for social engineering risks but lacked validation and adaptability to real-world complex- ities. SCVI addresses these shortcomings, offering a robust and scalable framework validated through survey (iPoll) and social media (Reddit) datasets. Finally, this work shows that user vulnerability can be as- sessed using survey responses and textual data from social media. Social media interactions provide insights into manipu- lative attempts, deceptive offers, and exploitation patterns tar- geting specific demographics [14, 35]. SCVI leverages these insights to highlight trends, enabling platforms to craft strate- 1 arXiv:2503.20806v1 [cs.CR] 24 Mar 2025 gies tailored to threats like AI-powered phishing or deepfake- related scams [29]. By encompassing diverse data sources, SCVI advances cybersecurity practices, ensuring inclusivity and adaptability in addressing evolving threats. The primary goal of this work is to develop and validate SCVI, a comprehensive framework that integrates individual- level factors (e.g., awareness, psychological traits, behav- ioral characteristics) and attack-level characteristics (e.g., fre- quency, consequence, sophistication) [18, 30]. Through di- verse data sources, this study aims to enhance socio-cyber vulnerability assessment, providing actionable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and platforms to design targeted interventions and close gaps in traditional metrics. 1.2 Key Contributions This work makes the following key contributions: 1. Innovative Social Cyber Vulnerability Metric: This re- search introduces the Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI). This novel framework integrates individual-level factors (e.g., awareness, behavioral traits, psychological attributes) and attack-level characteristics (e.g., frequency, consequence, sophistication). SCVI addresses gaps in tra- ditional metrics like CVSS and SVI, offering a compre- hensive tool for assessing socio-cyber vulnerabilities. Its robust methodology, including feature extraction from sur- vey and social media data and multi-dimensional vulnera- bility visualization, underscores its adaptability and utility. 2. Validation Across Diverse Data Sources: SCVI is val- idated using survey data (iPoll) and textual data (Reddit scam reports), demonstrating versatility across modalities. By incorporating individual and contextual factors, SCVI provides granular insights into cyber vulnerabilities, reveal- ing geographical and demographic disparities that inform region-specific interventions and tailored strategies. 3. Rigorous Empirical Validation and Comparison: Sen- sitivity and weight variability analyses validate SCVI’s reliability and robustness. Monte Carlo simulations high- light the dynamic contributions of individual and attack- level factors to SCVI variability. Comparative evaluations with CVSS and SVI confirm SCVI’s superior ability to capture nuanced vulnerabilities while aligning with CVSS for technical risks and addressing gaps in socio-contextual indices like SVI. 4. Practical Implications for Inclusive Cybersecurity: SCVI supports targeted recommendations for policymak- ers, social media platforms, and cybersecurity practitioners by identifying high-risk groups and various scam typolo- gies such as financial scams, phishing attacks, romance scams, online shopping fraud, tech support scams, etc. Its emphasis on demographic and sociocultural dimensions advances inclusivity. Future directions include expanding SCVI’s geographic and demographic coverage, optimizing weighting with data-driven approaches, and adapting to emerging threats like AI-powered phishing and deepfake fraud, ensuring its ongoing relevance. 2 Related Work 2.1 Cyber Vulnerability Metrics & Indices Black et al. [6] evaluated CVSS for standardizing and assess- ing software vulnerabilities based on exploitability and impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Flanagan et al. [15] introduced the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to iden- tify vulnerable communities using socio-economic factors but did not address cyber vulnerabilities. Bolpagni [7] pro- posed a socio-technical Cyber Risk Index, linking higher HDI with lower cyber risk, though it excludes social media risks. Frauenstein and Flowerday [16] explored personality traits influencing phishing susceptibility but overlooked cultural factors and perceived risk. While CVSS and SVI overlook nu- ances in social engineering and modern cyber vulnerabilities, particularly in social media and evolving online threats, the Cyber Risk Index fails to address these threats’ rapid evolu- tion. Frauenstein and Flowerday [16] highlighted personality traits but neglected broader contextual factors. To contextualize cybersecurity metrics, Bhol et al. [5] pro- posed a taxonomy categorizing metrics into vulnerabilities, protections, threats, users, and situations, leveraging Multi- Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to enhance organizational cybersecurity. Similarly, Van Haastrecht et al. [45] reviewed socio-technical cybersecurity metrics for SMEs, introducing the SYMBALS method to prioritize and evaluate metrics, leading to a socio-technical framework tailored for SMEs. Further, Alim et al. [3] proposed metrics like Individual Vul- nerability (VI) and Relative Vulnerability (VR) to assess so- cial engineering risks in online networks. However, the frame- works in [5, 45] may not reflect the latest advancements and can lack responsiveness to evolving threats. Although the VI and VR [3] are innovative, they require validation and may oversimplify real-world network complexities, limiting their practical applicability. These gaps highlight the need for an inclusive vulnerability metric considering victim characteristics, demographics, and attack-specific factors. Existing frameworks fail to capture the evolving nature of social cyber threats, underscoring the importance of specialized tools to better protect vulnerable populations. 2.2 AI-Driven Cybersecurity Solutions Maddireddy and Maddireddy [29] proposed a multi-modal AI framework integrating machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) for ransomware detec- tion. Evaluated on datasets like VirusShare and UNSW-NB15, it achieved high detection rates and adversarial robustness. Jamil et al. [24] introduced the MPMPA model to mitigate 2 phishing on Facebook, employing finite-state machines for detection and real-time alerts validated through realistic sce- narios. Prasad et al. [35] developed SnorCall, using semi- supervised learning for analyzing illegal robocalls, achieving high labeling accuracy (90 - 100%) and insights into scam operations. These studies demonstrated innovative AI appli- cations for specific cybersecurity threats. However, limita- tions exist. The framework in [29] faces a lack of scalability and interpretability, while MPMPA [24]’s focus on Facebook limits its generalizability. SnorCall [35]’s reliance on tran- sient data and manual labeling introduced biases and ethical concerns. These limitations reflect the broader challenges in AI-driven cybersecurity, such as scalability, model inter- pretability, ethical considerations, and adaptability to dynamic threat landscapes, underscoring the need for further research and development to enhance robustness and usability. 2.3 Key Predictors of Vulnerability Koning et al. [27] used Dutch survey data to examine socio- demographics, personality traits, and internet activities in fraud victimization, identifying higher risks for younger in- dividuals, frequent internet users, and those with lower self- control, with openness to experience increasing susceptibility. Sur et al. [41] analyzed older adults, showing well-being and cognitive ability reduced fraud risk, while negative life events and loneliness increased it. Williams et al. [48] linked credit card fraud to financial confidence, training, marital status, and homeownership. Judges et al. [25] found lower cognitive abil- ity and reduced honesty-humility as key predictors among older adults. However, their works are limited to reliance on post-fraud measurements [27], self-reported data [41, 48], and small, non-diverse samples [25]. These findings show the role of cognitive ability, personality traits, and socio-demographic factors in understanding vulnerability to social cyber threats, underscoring the need for broader, more robust studies. 2.4 Geographic, Demographic, and Temporal Dimensions of Social Scam Fraud Edwards et al. [14] analyzed 5,402 online dating scam pro- files, revealing Nigeria as a major source (30%) and identi- fying text/image reuse patterns via IP geolocation. Nguyen et al. [30] examined crime patterns in India using regression analysis, finding links between demographic factors and re- gional disparities. G. Nejad and Sabzian [18] investigated U.S. consumer financial fraud trends (2018–2022), noting spatial clustering of fraud, especially post-COVID-19, using techniques like Moran’s I. However, they could not resolve issues with dataset biases and proxy use [14], relied on sec- ondary data lacking qualitative insights [30], and encountered underreporting and oversimplification in spatial analyses [18]. Despite these issues, they underscored the need for compre- hensive methodologies to address fraud’s complex dynamics. The Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI) introduced here bridges these gaps by integrating data sources like social media and surveys. It offers a context-aware framework to assess vulnerabilities across diverse contexts, transcending prior limitations in adaptability and inclusivity. 3 Measuring Social Cyber Vulnerabilities 3.1 Key Vulnerability Factors to Social Scams Social scams represent a specialized category of online fraud [26], targeting victims through interactive channels such as email, websites, social media, and chat rooms. While online fraud typically leverages digital mediums to facilitate fraud- ulent activities, social scams focus on exploiting personal relationships, social dynamics, and trust [20]. This manipula- tion often involves deceptive communications or persuasive tactics, ultimately aiming to defraud individuals by undermin- ing their behavioral and psychological defenses [42]. This work considers the following factors that shape an individual’s susceptibility to social cyberattacks. These fac- tors align with the dimensions incorporated into the proposed Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI), which can be the basis for assessing risk to a given social scam: 1. Individual Awareness and Knowledge: This captures how well individuals understand social cyber threats and the protective measures available. Limited awareness and knowledge of specific scam types or associated security mechanisms heighten vulnerability [2]. 2. Behavioral Patterns: This factor encompasses an indi- vidual’s online activities and security practices. Frequent exposure to risky platforms or inadequate protective be- haviors can raise the likelihood of victimization [36]. 3. Psychological Factors: This considers traits like trust and risk perception. Excessive trust in unfamiliar communi- cations or a diminished sense of risk often translates into heightened susceptibility to scams [37]. 4. Past Experience: This reflects prior encounters with so- cial cyberattacks, including the individual’s responses and recovery strategies. Experiences can either strengthen re- silience or, if inadequately addressed, leave persistent vul- nerabilities [17]. 5. Frequency of Attacks: This refers to the number of scam attempts a user encounters. A higher frequency increases the likelihood of at least one attack succeeding. Moreover, repeated scam exposure can desensitize individuals, poten- tially reducing their vigilance over time [47]. 6. Consequences of Attacks: This involves significant fi- nancial or emotional harm that can exacerbate overall vul- nerability, as high-stakes repercussions often leave lasting negative impacts [33]. 7. Sophistication of Attacks: This assesses how convinc- ingly a scam mimics legitimate communications or ex- 3 ploits personal information. Highly sophisticated (or re- alistic) social cyberattacks are more difficult to detect, elevating the victim’s susceptibility [11]. By examining these interrelated factors, the SCVI provides a holistic measure of an individual’s susceptibility to social cyberattacks. While numerous factors can contribute to vul- nerabilities in social scams, this study focuses on seven key elements identified in existing research. We assess these fac- tors using survey and social media datasets. 3.2 Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI) We propose the Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI), assessing susceptibility to cyber social scams by evaluating individual vulnerability and attack severity factors. The SCVI is formulated by: SCVI𝑖,𝑘= 𝛼·IVI𝑖,𝑘+ 𝛽·ASI𝑖,𝑘. (1) The IVI𝑖,𝑘represents the Individual Vulnerability Index, in- dicating the vulnerability of an individual 𝑖to an attack 𝑘, while ASI𝑖,𝑘denotes the Attack Severity Index, representing the impact of attack 𝑘on individual 𝑖. The weights 𝛼and 𝛽 are assigned to IVI and ASI, respectively, with 𝛼+ 𝛽= 1. IVI𝑖,𝑘is given by: IVI𝑖,𝑘= 𝑤𝐴𝑖,𝑘·A𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝐵𝑖,𝑘·B𝑖,𝑘+ (2) 𝑤𝑃𝑖,𝑘·P𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝐸𝑖,𝑘·E𝑖,𝑘, where A𝑖,𝑘= A𝐴 𝑖,𝑘+A𝐾 𝑖,𝑘, B𝑖,𝑘= B𝑅 𝑖,𝑘+B𝑆 𝑖,𝑘, P𝑖,𝑘= P𝐶 𝑖,𝑘+P𝐼 𝑖,𝑘, E𝑖,𝑘= E𝐸 𝑖,𝑘+E𝑅 𝑖,𝑘, and 𝑤𝐴𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝐵𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝑃𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝐸𝑖,𝑘= 1. The lack of individual 𝑖’s awareness and knowledge (A𝑖,𝑘) includes unfamiliarity with social cyberattack 𝑘(A𝐴 𝑖,𝑘) and knowledge of protective measures against 𝑘(A𝐾 𝑖,𝑘). Behav- ioral patterns (B𝑖,𝑘) involve the frequency of risk-enhancing behaviors (B𝑅 𝑖,𝑘) and the use of security practices (B𝑆 𝑖,𝑘). Psy- chological factors (P𝑖,𝑘) include trust in communications related to 𝑘(P𝐶 𝑖,𝑘) and risk perception and impulsivity (P𝐼 𝑖,𝑘). Experience (E𝑖,𝑘) reflects past encounters with 𝑘(E𝐸 𝑖,𝑘) and responses to such incidents (E𝑅 𝑖,𝑘). ASI𝑖,𝑘is defined by: ASI𝑖,𝑘= 𝑤𝐹𝑖,𝑘·F𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝐶𝑖,𝑘·C𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝑆𝑖,𝑘·S𝑖,𝑘, (3) where F𝑖,𝑘= F𝑇𝐴 𝑖,𝑘+F𝐴𝐴 𝑖,𝑘, C𝑖,𝑘= C𝐹𝐼 𝑖,𝑘+C𝑃𝐼 𝑖,𝑘+C𝑆𝐼 𝑖,𝑘, S𝑖,𝑘= S𝐶 𝑖,𝑘+ S𝑆𝐸 𝑖,𝑘, and 𝑤𝐹𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝐶𝑖,𝑘+ 𝑤𝑆𝑖,𝑘= 1, respectively. The impact of the frequency of attack 𝑘(F𝑖,𝑘) is deter- mined by the frequency of attempted attacks (F𝑇𝐴 𝑖,𝑘) and the frequency of actual attacks encountered (F𝐴𝐴 𝑖,𝑘). The conse- quence of a successful attack 𝑘on individual 𝑖(C𝑖,𝑘) is repre- sented by its financial impact (C𝐹𝐼 𝑖,𝑘), emotional or psycholog- ical impact (C𝑃𝐼 𝑖,𝑘), and impact on personal safety (C𝑆𝐼 𝑖,𝑘). The sophistication of attack 𝑘(S𝑖,𝑘) as perceived by individual 𝑖 consists of the perceived degree to which the attack mimics legitimate communications (S𝐶 𝑖,𝑘) and the use of personalized information or advanced social engineering techniques (S𝑆𝐸 𝑖,𝑘). We consider the scale for each component (e.g., A𝑖,𝑘) to be in [0,5], and its value will be represented as an integer. The IVI𝑖,𝑘can be captured based on a Likert-scale (i.e., from 0 to 5) questionnaire or derived from an online user’s behavioral or lexical characteristics in social media. The ASI𝑖,𝑘can be represented by the key characteristics of each attack perceived by online users [50]. The assigned weights for IVI and ASI balance individual vulnerability and attack severity, ensuring SCVI’s effectiveness for assessment and targeted interven- tions by integrating key factors across both dimensions. 4 Estimating SCVI This section details the estimation of SCVI using two datasets: survey data from the iPoll dataset and social media data from Reddit scam reports. Integrating iPoll’s survey-based mea- sures of risky behaviors and protective knowledge with Red- dit’s user-generated scam reports, the SCVI achieves both statistical rigor and contextual depth, resulting in a compre- hensive and adaptable measure of social cyber vulnerability. Together, these two datasets form a complementary founda- tion for SCVI estimation. 4.1 SCVI Using the iPoll Dataset To compute the Social Cyber Vulnerability Index (SCVI), we utilize the survey data from the iPoll dataset [1]. The dataset, The Impostors: Stealing Money, Damaging Lives. An AARP National Survey of Adults 18+ (iPoll) thoroughly examines scam awareness, experiences, and behaviors among 4,596 adults across the United States. Conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago between January 2 and January 16, 2020. The dataset captures diverse aspects of online behavior, personal traits, and specific scams, such as romance scams, government impostor scams, and identity theft, across 113 variables. It employs computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and web-based surveys, offering robust regional and national insights. While weighting factors are provided for analysis accuracy, the dataset highlights varying levels of scam susceptibility and awareness among different demo- graphics, making it a critical resource for understanding and mitigating cyber vulnerabilities. Modeling the Individual Vulnerability Index (IVI). IVI is modeled from the iPoll dataset by encoding and aggregat- ing participant responses across seven dimensions reflecting cyber vulnerability. These dimensions include lack of Aware- ness (A𝐴 𝑖,𝑘),lack of Knowledge of Protective Measures (A𝐾 𝑖,𝑘), Frequency of Risk-Enhancing Behaviors (B𝑅 𝑖,𝑘), Trust Level (P𝐶 𝑖,𝑘), Risk Perception and Impulsivity (P𝐼 𝑖,𝑘), Past Encounters 4 (E𝐸 𝑖,𝑘), and Responses to Past Incidents (E𝑅 𝑖,𝑘). Each dimension is calculated by mapping survey responses to numerical scores based on predefined encoding schemes. For example, in A𝐴 𝑖,𝑘, a response of "Very concerned" is assigned a score of 0 (in- dicating high vulnerability), whereas "Not at all concerned" receives a score of 3. Similarly, responses like "False" in A𝐾 𝑖,𝑘 are assigned a score of 5, reflecting higher vulnerability due to incorrect protective knowledge. Each dimension is computed by averaging the encoded scores of relevant survey questions. The A𝐴 𝑖,𝑘factor mea- sures familiarity-related concerns, while B𝑅 𝑖,𝑘captures the frequency of risk-enhancing behaviors, using scores derived from questions about daily or infrequent online activities. The Trust factor (P𝐶 𝑖,𝑘) and Impulsivity factor (P𝐼 𝑖,𝑘) are evaluated using responses about personal traits and decision-making tendencies, respectively. Encounters with cyber threats (E𝐸 𝑖,𝑘) and responses to incidents (E𝑅 𝑖,𝑘) are scored based on the fre- quency and severity of past experiences, including financial losses and emotional distress. The final IVI score was computed as a weighted average of these factors by IVI = 1 7  A𝐴 𝑖,𝑘+A𝐾 𝑖,𝑘+B𝑅 𝑖,𝑘+P𝐶 𝑖,𝑘+P𝐼 𝑖,𝑘+E𝐸 𝑖,𝑘+ E𝑅 𝑖,𝑘 . This comprehensive index quantifies individual vulner- ability factors based on familiarity, behavior, experience, and personality traits. This approach captures multidimensional aspects of vulnerability across participants. Modeling the Attack Severity Index (ASI). ASI is derived from the iPoll dataset by encoding and aggregating survey re- sponses across key dimensions: Frequency, Consequence, and Sophistication. Survey questions were mapped to numerical values using predefined encoding schemes, assigning higher scores to responses indicating greater risk or vulnerability. Frequency (F𝑖,𝑘) was calculated as the sum of responses from questions measuring the prevalence of cyber events, with a score of 5 indicating frequent occurrences. Consequence (C𝑖,𝑘) aggregated scores from questions reflecting emotional, physical, or financial impacts, capturing outcome severity. Sophistication (S𝑖,𝑘) represented situational plausibility by summing scores from questions assessing the perceived legit- imacy and sophistication of threats. The ASI was computed as a weighted combination of these three components, with equal weights assigned to ensure a balanced vulnerability assessment. This comprehensive met- ric captures event frequency, outcome severity, and threat sophistication, offering insights into individual and systemic vulnerabilities. The encoded dataset facilitates further analysis across demographic and behavioral factors, enabling nuanced comparisons within the surveyed population. The detailed feature extraction process for the IVI and ASI from the iPoll dataset is provided in Tables 4 and 5 in the appendices, respectively. 4.2 SCVI Using the Reddit Scam Reports The Reddit Scam Reports dataset comprises user-generated posts from the subreddit r/scams, where individuals share experiences with scams. Spanning data from 2016 to 2023 (via the Pushshift API) and additional records from October to November 2024, the dataset focuses on scam reports for analysis. From an initial 5,000 observations, 450 scam reports were selected, ensuring equal representation across years. Preprocessing steps included slang replacement, URL re- moval, and stripping mentions and hashtags. Text normaliza- tion involved converting to lowercase, expanding contractions, reducing elongated words, and removing non-alphanumeric characters while retaining punctuations. This cleaned dataset supports effective annotation of scam types and success met- rics (successful or unsuccessful scams), providing a solid foundation for modeling and analyzing scam dynamics. Modeling the Individual Vulnerability Index (IVI). The SCVI assesses individual vulnerabilities through key dimen- sions that capture user-specific factors influencing suscepti- bility to cyber threats. These dimensions offer a holistic view of personal risk, encompassing awareness, behaviors, psycho- logical attributes, and prior experiences, collectively termed IVI. Below, we outline the core components of IVI: • Individual Lack of Awareness and Knowledge (A): This measure evaluates users’ exposure to scam-prevention strategies via fine-grained annotations of scam types and success. Participation in virtual communities improves well- being and knowledge sharing, reducing scam susceptibil- ity [4]. Frequent engagement with scam discussions fosters familiarity with scams and avoidance methods, lowering vulnerability. • Behavioral Traits (B): Behavioral vulnerability is modeled by analyzing user interaction frequency, such as posting be- havior and linguistic markers. Frequent engagement with scam-related discussions, reflected in posts or reports, may indicate risk-taking or impulsive behavior linked to scam susceptibility [21]. Tools like Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) [34] assess markers such as clout scores, perceptual language, and informal markers [44]. For exam- ple, low clout scores suggest low confidence, while reliance on sensory descriptions indicates vulnerability to scams leveraging fake credibility cues. Behavioral traits like low self-confidence and over-reliance on perceptual processes significantly affect scam susceptibility [33]. Specific lan- guage patterns in online communities also influence sus- ceptibility to scams and manipulative content [43], while skepticism, reflected in negations ("no," "not," "never"), helps resist misinformation and identify scams [49]. • Psychological Factors (P): Analytical thinking, emotional states, and personality traits significantly influence scam susceptibility. LIWC outputs, such as "affect" scores for emotional language and "cognitive processes" scores for 5 critical thinking, provide insights into these dimensions. Strong analytical and cognitive skills enhance scam resis- tance [23], while better cognitive abilities improve financial decision-making [19]. Emotional states like anxiety and neuroticism impair decision-making, increasing suscepti- bility [8, 10], with stress further exacerbating vulnerability [32]. Credulity, rather than general trust, is a specific fraud risk factor among older adults [39]. A psychological vulner- ability score, derived using LIWC, identifies potential risks through markers like high emotional language, excessive exclamations, or overly positive tones ("posemo"), while skepticism and reflective thinking reduce vulnerability. • Experiences (E): Prior exposure to scams is evaluated through annotations of posts detailing personal experiences, such as financial losses or emotional distress. This includes identifying whether users were scam victims. Such ex- posure may increase awareness or reinforce susceptibil- ity [22, 40]. Modeling the Attack Severity Index (ASI). ASI is mod- eled by annotating scam reports for two critical attributes: scam type and scam success. The annotation process is con- ducted by two human annotators, with additional refinement using OpenAI’s API. Scam types include phishing, investment scams, lottery scams, tech support scams, romance scams, on- line shopping scams, job scams, and undetected. Scam success is represented as a binary variable (0 or 1). The ASI consists of three key components: • Frequency (F): The frequency component quantifies the number of reported incidents for each scam type, providing insights into the prevalence of various scams [22]. • Consequence (C): The consequence of an attack assesses the impact of successful scams by analyzing financial losses [28] and emotional distress [38, 46]. Annotated re- ports capture monetary losses, while NLP techniques like emotion recognition models evaluate emotional impacts by aggregating positive and negative emotions in scam reports. • Sophistication (S): The sophistication of an attack [13] measures the effectiveness of scams based on the proportion of successful scams relative to total reports within each type. Higher success rates indicate greater sophistication in deceiving victims, reflecting the severity of these scams. 5 Evaluation Setup Sensitivity Analysis of Weighting Schemes on SCVI Scores Using iPoll and Reddit Data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of varying weighting schemes on SCVI scores using two datasets: iPoll and Reddit scam reports. The analysis focused on the IVI components (𝑤𝐴,𝑤𝐵,𝑤𝑃,𝑤𝐸) and ASI components (𝑤𝐹,𝑤𝐶,𝑤𝑆). The impact of each weight on the mean SCVI score and its vari- ability was visualized and quantitatively assessed. This analy- sis provides insights into the relative importance of different vulnerability factors and helps identify the most influential components driving SCVI variations. Monte Carlo Simulation for Analyzing Weight Variability and Uncertainty in SCVI Scores. Monte Carlo simula- tions examined the uncertainty in SCVI scores by employing random sampling to model the effects of weight variability on the SCVI distribution. The plausible weight ranges for IVI (𝑤𝐴,𝑤𝐵,𝑤𝑃,𝑤𝐸) and ASI (𝑤𝐹,𝑤𝐶,𝑤𝑆) were defined, ensuring that each index’s weights sum to one. Over 10,000 iterations, SCVI scores were recalculated, and aggregated results were analyzed to identify key patterns and weight con- figurations. This approach allows for a robust evaluation of potential fluctuations in SCVI scores, offering a deeper under- standing of their stability under different weighting scenarios. Evaluation of SCVI Against CVSS and SVI. The SCVI was evaluated against established indices, including the Com- mon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [31] and the So- cial Vulnerability Index (SVI) [9]. CVSS is a widely used framework for rating software vulnerabilities, prioritizing management based on metrics such as Base, Temporal, and Environmental factors. Similarly, the SCVI employs metric- based mappings to assess fraud victimization, incorporating elements like attack vector, complexity, user interaction, and impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The SVI quantifies community-level vulnerabilities to dis- asters and public health emergencies by focusing on sociode- mographic and infrastructural factors. The SCVI extends these considerations by integrating survey data on individual behaviors, demographics, and cyber threat exposure, offering a composite view of individual vulnerability. The evaluation involved calculating SCVI metrics and com- paring them with CVSS and SVI scores derived from the iPoll dataset. This approach enabled a comprehensive analysis of SCVI’s capacity to integrate cyber-related behavioral data with sociodemographic factors, bridging established frame- works. Results are presented using tables to analyze signifi- cance, correlations, and outliers across demographic groups, including age, race-ethnicity, and gender. 6 Analyses of Evaluation Results SCVI was estimated using the iPoll and Reddit datasets and compared with two existing metrics: SVI and CVSS. 6.1 Analyses of SCVI Analysis of the iPoll Dataset. The analysis of the iPoll dataset reveals significant insights into user vulnerabilities and attack severity. Figure 1(a) illustrates the distribution of the IVI factors. The Behavioral factor exhibits a concentra- tion of values around 1, indicating that most users engage minimally in behaviors that might increase their susceptibility 6 to scams. However, the Psychological factor shows a more even distribution, with most users scoring between 2 and 4, reflecting moderate psychological attributes influencing their vulnerability. The Experience factor is heavily skewed to- wards lower values, suggesting that many users have little to no prior exposure to scams. Meanwhile, the Awareness and Knowledge factor is widespread, with many users demonstrat- ing low to moderate awareness of scams. Figure 2(b) compares the IVI and ASI. The IVI distribution is between 2 and 3, reflecting moderate vulnerability levels among most users. In contrast, the ASI distribution is heavily skewed towards lower values, with a substantial frequency at 0, indicating that many users face attacks with minimal severity. However, a smaller yet significant group experiences higher ASI values around 4 and 5, highlighting the presence of severe attack cases. This disparity underscores the need to address user vulnerabilities and the impact of high-severity attacks to ensure comprehensive protection. The factors contributing to the ASI provide additional in- sights, as shown in Figure 1(c). The Frequency factor reveals a bimodal distribution, with peaks near 0 and 5, indicating that users either rarely or frequently encounter scams. The Consequence factor is concentrated around moderate values, reflecting that the overall impact of scams is neither negligi- ble nor catastrophic for most users. The Sophistication factor shows a diverse distribution, with peaks near both ends of the scale. This suggests a wide variation in the perceived authen- ticity and persuasiveness of scam attempts, with some being highly convincing while others are easily recognized. In conclusion, the analysis of the iPoll dataset demonstrates a consistent pattern of low user vulnerability paired with high attack severity. The distribution of IVI and ASI factors sug- gests that while users may not frequently engage in risky be- haviors, they remain vulnerable to severe and highly convinc- ing scams. This highlights the need for targeted educational initiatives and awareness campaigns to reduce the impact of scams on vulnerable populations. Analysis of Reddit Dataset. The distribution of the Indi- vidual Vulnerability Index (IVI) factors provides insights into user vulnerability, as shown in Figure 2(a). The Behavioral factor displays a strong skew towards lower values, indicat- ing that most users exhibit low engagement in behaviors that might increase their susceptibility to scams. In contrast, the Psychological factor demonstrates a more balanced distribu- tion, with most users scoring between 2 and 4, suggesting moderate psychological attributes contributing to vulnerabil- ity. The Experience factor is concentrated at discrete points, with a significant number of users reporting no prior scam en- counters, while a smaller group shows high values, reflecting substantial past interactions with scams. Lastly, the Awareness and Knowledge factor is heavily skewed towards lower values, highlighting a general lack of awareness and knowledge about scams among users. A comparison of the IVI and the Attack Severity Index (ASI) reveals a clear distinction in their distributions, as shown in Figure 2(b). The IVI primarily concentrates between 1 and 2, reflecting low to moderate vulnerability levels for most users. Conversely, the ASI distribution is shifted towards higher values, with the majority of users scoring between 3 and 4. This suggests that while users might exhibit relatively low vulnerability, the severity of the attacks they encounter is notably higher. This disparity underscores the need for tar- geted measures to bridge the gap between user vulnerability and the impact of the scams they experience. The factors contributing to the ASI provide further insights into the nature of scams, as illustrated in Figure 2(c). The Frequency factor is highly polarized, with peaks near 0 and 5, suggesting that users experience either very frequent or infrequent attacks. The Consequence factor has a moderate peak around 3, indicating that the impact of scams is generally moderate for most users. However, the Sophistication factor, which measures the effectiveness of scams, displays a bimodal distribution with peaks near 2 and 4. This highlights varying levels of success and persuasiveness in scam attempts, with some being highly convincing while others are less so. In conclusion, the analysis highlights a critical mismatch between user vulnerability and the severity of attacks. While most users exhibit low IVI scores, the high ASI values indicate that the attacks they encounter are often severe and impactful. Addressing this disparity requires enhancing user awareness and psychological resilience, particularly in recognizing and mitigating high-severity scams. These findings provide a foun- dation for designing effective strategies to reduce the impact of scams on vulnerable populations. 6.2 Sensitivity Analysis of IVI and ASI Com- ponents on SCVI Variability The sensitivity analysis on the ipoll dataset reveals key trends in the contributions of IVI and ASI components to SCVI variability, as shown in Figure 4. In the IVI, the Awareness factor (𝑤𝐴) consistently increased SCVI scores, highlighting the exacerbating effect of lack of awareness. The Experience factor (𝑤𝐸) showed a decreasing trend with fluctuations, indi- cating interactions with other components. The Psychological factor (𝑤𝑃) strongly correlated with increased SCVI, while the Behavioral factor (𝑤𝐵) had minimal positive influence, reflecting limited impact in the Reddit context. Regarding ASI components within the ipoll dataset, the Frequency factor (𝑤𝐹) showed a strong negative correlation with SCVI, indicating that lower frequencies of cyber-attacks increase vulnerability. The Consequence factor (𝑤𝐶) con- sistently decreased SCVI scores as its weight increased, re- flecting the mitigating effect of preparedness against high- consequence events. The Sophistication factor (𝑤𝑆) displayed a mild positive trend with variability, suggesting its impact on SCVI depends on interactions with other factors. 7 (a) Distributions of IVI factors (b) Distributions of IVI and ASI values (c) Distributions of ASI factors Figure 1: Comparison of IVI and ASI distributions and their contributing factors using the iPoll dataset.

The analysis of the Reddit dataset mirrored ipoll findings mostly but revealed differences in factor impacts, as in Fig- ure 3. The strong exacerbating effects of higher weights in Awareness (𝑤𝐴) and mitigating effects of Experience (𝑤𝐸) on SCVI were consistent across both datasets. In contrast, the Psychological factor (𝑤𝑃) exhibited a slight negative driver of SCVI. The Behavioral factor (𝑤𝐵) showed a slight nega- tive correlation with SCVI in the Reddit dataset, in compar- ison with the ipoll analysis. For the ASI components, Fre- quency (𝑤𝐹) was again a major contributor to SCVI in both datasets, though its impact was stronger in the Reddit data. The Consequence factor (𝑤𝐶) similarly reduced SCVI across both datasets but had a more pronounced effect in the Reddit dataset. The Sophistication factor (𝑤𝑆) had a more consistent and significant positive impact on SCVI in the iPoll dataset compared to its less stable influence in the Reddit dataset. These analyses underscore the robust yet context-sensitive nature of SCVI components across different datasets. The universal impacts of Awareness, Experience, Consequence and Frequency on SCVI were evident. Nonetheless, variations in the magnitude and direction of relationships for Psycho- logical, Behavioral and Sophistication factors across datasets highlight the influence of data-specific attributes. Further in- vestigations into additional datasets and varying contexts can enhance the applicability and robustness of SCVI as a compre- hensive metric for assessing cyber vulnerabilities. We leave this for our future research. 6.3 Effect of Weight Variability in SCVI The SCVI values and corresponding weight configurations were aggregated across multiple iterations to identify key patterns, as shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b). The results high- lighted two primary peaks shown in Figure 5(a) for the iPoll dataset: Primary Peak (Group 1): SCVI was predominantly driven by Experience (𝑤𝐸) in the Individual Vulnerability Index (IVI) and Sophistication (𝑊𝑆) in the Attack Severity Index (ASI). Experience made the largest contribution to IVI, with a mean value of 0.421 and a standard deviation of 0.084. Similarly, Sophistication dominated ASI contributions, with a mean value of 0.447 and a standard deviation of 0.095. These findings emphasize the importance of systemic Sophistication and individual experience in influencing SCVI scores. Secondary Peak (Group 2): SCVI values were primar- ily influenced by Awareness (𝑤𝐴) and Psychological Factors (𝑤𝑃) in IVI, as well as Frequency (𝑤𝐹) in ASI. Awareness emerged as a significant IVI contributor (Mean: 0.372, Std: 0.026), while Frequency was the dominant ASI factor (Mean: 0.436, Std: 0.033). In this group, Sophistication and Experi- 8 (a) Varying the weights of the IVI factors (b) Varying the weights of the ASI factors Figure 3: Sensitivity analysis of the iPoll dataset for IVI and ASI factors.

We find the following observation in Figure 5(b), which analyzed the Reddit dataset. Low SCVI Outliers: SCVI values exhibited low variabil- ity, ranging from 1.039 to 1.098, indicating consistency. Be- havioral Factors (𝑤𝐵) emerged as the dominant contributor, ranging from 0.33 to 0.37, with Experience (𝑤𝐸) also playing a significant role in certain cases. 𝛼values ranged between 0.562 and 0.593, slightly favoring IVI, while 𝛽values from 0.406 to 0.437 represented a balanced ASI contribution. This indicates that user behaviors, such as risk-taking tendencies and prior experiences, significantly influence SCVI, while the overall stability of the metric reflects a robust model for assessing vulnerabilities. High SCVI Outliers: SCVI values showed greater vari- ability, ranging from 2.182 to 2.211. Experience (𝑤𝐸) and Frequency (𝑤𝐹) were the most influential factors, consistently exceeding 0.45, highlighting the importance of users’ prior ex- posure to scams and the prevalence of cyberattack attempts in shaping vulnerabilities. and 𝛼values between 0.403 and 0.419 suggested a balanced primary contribution from IVI compo- nents, while and 𝛽values between 0.580 and 0.596 indicated a stronger impact from ASI components. This distribution suggests that while individual vulnerability factors contribute significantly, the attack-specific characteristics, particularly frequency, dominate overall SCVI scores. Comparative Analysis: Both datasets highlight the domi- nant roles of Experience (𝑤𝐸) and Frequency (𝑤𝐹) in driving SCVI scores. However, the Reddit dataset emphasized Behav- ioral Factors (𝑤𝐵) in low SCVI cases and a more pronounced influence of Frequency in high SCVI cases, suggesting that user behaviors are more critical in reducing vulnerability, while the prevalence of cyberattacks becomes a stronger driver 9 of high SCVI scores. In contrast, the iPoll dataset demon- strated stronger contributions from Sophistication (𝑊𝑆) and Awareness (𝑤𝐴), reflecting the importance of user Awareness and the complexity of attacks in shaping vulnerabilities. This comparison underscores the contextual differences between datasets, highlighting the varying impacts of individual be- haviors and attack characteristics on SCVI. Summarizing the insights above, while SCVI components exhibit universal trends, their relative contributions differ sig- nificantly across datasets, reflecting the contextual character- istics of the data. For instance, the iPoll dataset highlights the dominant roles of Sophistication (𝑊𝑆) and Awareness (𝑤𝐴), emphasizing the importance of attack complexity and user awareness in shaping vulnerabilities. Conversely, the Reddit dataset underscores the critical influence of Behavioral Fac- tors (𝑤𝐵) in low SCVI cases and Frequency (𝑤𝐹) in high SCVI cases, illustrating the varying impacts of user behaviors and cyberattack prevalence. This variability highlights that tailoring SCVI metrics is critical to the specific attributes of the analyzed dataset. Future research could delve deeper into these dynamics to enhance SCVI’s adaptability and robustness, enabling more accurate assessments of vulnerabilities across diverse environments. 6.4 Comparative Analysis with SVI and CVSS Across Demographic Groups The SCVI metric effectively captures individual-level vulner- abilities in social cyber contexts, surpassing SVI and CVSS through its integration of socio-demographic, behavioral, and cyber-specific dimensions. As shown in Figure 6, correlation analysis reveals a moderate positive correlation with CVSS (Spearman = 0.33, p = 0.0), indicating alignment in identify- ing technological vulnerabilities. In contrast, SCVI exhibits a weaker correlation with SVI (-0.01, p = 0.4836), reflect- ing SVI’s broader socio-environmental focus, which lacks specificity in cyber-related risks. SCVI complements CVSS and SVI by incorporating di- mensions that address individual vulnerabilities in socio-cyber contexts. Its alignment with CVSS and divergence from SVI highlight its ability to integrate social and behavioral factors, making it a vital tool for inclusive cybersecurity strategies. Analysis of trends across gender, race-ethnicity, and age groups reveals consistent patterns in vulnerability metrics. Table 1 shows that the male group has the highest SVI, CVSS, and SCVI values at 2.57, 3.52, and 3.47, respectively. The SVI difference between male and female groups is relatively minimal (2.36%), while CVSS and SCVI show significantly larger gaps at 9.84% and 16.88%, potentially due to exposure to riskier technological environments. As shown in Table 2, among racial and ethnic groups, the White, non-Hispanic group has the lowest values across all indices, with SVI at 2.25 and CVSS at 3.02. Conversely, the Hispanic group records the highest values, with SVI, CVSS, Table 1: DISTRIBUTION OF SVI, CVSS, AND SCVI METRICS BY GENDER Gender SVI CVSS SCVI Female 2.51 3.19 2.93 Male 2.57 3.52 3.47 Table 2: DISTRIBUTION OF SVI, CVSS, AND SCVI METRICS BY RACE-ETHNICITY Race-Ethnicity SVI CVSS SCVI White, non-Hispanic 2.25 3.31 3.02 Black, non-Hispanic 3.34 3.34 3.40 Other, non-Hispanic 3.01 3.74 3.33 2+, non-Hispanic 2.89 3.32 3.14 Asian, non-Hispanic 2.90 3.32 3.02 Hispanic 3.72 4.06 3.79 and SCVI at 3.72, 3.79, and 4.06, respectively. SCVI generally exceeds CVSS, which in turn exceeds SVI. These findings suggest that targeted cybersecurity programs for Hispanic groups could address their higher vulnerability. In contrast, the lower scores for White, non-Hispanic groups may reflect better access to resources, education, or programs. Holistically, the three columns in Table 2 showcase a trend of SVI scores almost always being lower than that of CVSS or SCVI. In fact, the only two groups where SVI is not the lowest is: black, non-Hispanic (by 0.3%) and other, non-Hispanic (by 10%) race-ethnicity groups in the table. No group displayed SVI having the highest vulnerability index. In age group analysis, presented in Table 3, younger demo- graphics (18-24 and 25-29) are overall more vulnerable than older age groups with SCVI being the highest. This indicates a stronger susceptibility to social cyber vulnerabilities pos- sibly due to higher technology usage. As age increases, all metrics notably decrease with middle-aged and older-aged groups’ CVSS scores leading the other two metrics. Note that there is a slight increase in all metrics for the 45-49 and 50-54 age groups, perhaps indicating higher engagement but less awareness with technology and scams than neighboring age groups. SVI scores are also the lowest across all age groups. These findings validate SCVI as a robust and comprehen- sive metric, surpassing traditional indices in capturing nu- anced social cyber vulnerabilities. SCVI consistently exhibits the highest scores across demographic categories, emphasiz- ing its utility in identifying risks associated with technological behaviors and social factors. This distinction highlights its potential as a comprehensive tool for addressing individual- level vulnerabilities, particularly in demographic groups with higher susceptibility to cyber threats. 10 (a) Monte Carlo Analysis of SCVI Components in the iPoll Dataset: Primary and Secondary Peaks.

Figure 6: Spearman correlation heatmap across SCVI, SVI, and CVSS metrics. 6.5 Regional Disparities in Cyber Vulnerabil- ity: Analysis of SCVI Across U.S. States Using the iPoll Dataset The SCVI calculated from the iPoll dataset analyses regional disparities in cyber vulnerability across the United States. The dataset includes mean SCVI scores, confidence intervals, and sample sizes for each state, providing critical insights into the geographical distribution of cyber threats and the effectiveness of local cybersecurity measures. Data was visualized through a heatmap to illustrate the SCVI distribution, with color intensities adjusted based on sample sizes to reflect data reliability in Figure 7. Table 6 in the appendices provides a detailed summary of the state-wise SCVI scores, sample sizes, and confidence intervals. States like Alaska, Rhode Island, and Nevada, which exhibit higher mean SCVI scores and smaller sample sizes, suggest an Table 3: DISTRIBUTION OF SVI, CVSS, AND SCVI METRICS BY AGE GROUPS Age Group SVI CVSS SCVI 18-24 3.85 4.69 4.14 25-29 3.11 3.59 3.50 30-44 3.31 3.33 3.11 45-49 2.74 3.82 3.45 50-54 2.42 3.81 3.45 55-64 2.25 3.24 2.95 65+ 2.12 2.82 2.63 elevated risk level potentially influenced by regional factors. The wide confidence intervals in these measurements indicate a significant uncertainty in the SCVI estimates, attributed to the limited data availability. In contrast, populous states such as California, Texas, and New York demonstrate lower and more stable SCVI scores, suggesting either lower cyber vulnerability or more effec- tive cybersecurity practices . The robustness of data from these states provides clearer insights into their cyber health landscapes. The variability in SCVI scores between states like Connecticut and Pennsylvania, despite similar sample sizes, underscores the impact of socio-economic or infras- tructural factors on cyber vulnerability. This variability high- lights the complex dynamics affecting cybersecurity across regions.These observations align with the Federal Trade Com- mission’s (FTC) fraud reports in the 2020 FTC Data Book [12], which highlight similar regional trends in cyber fraud incidents and vulnerabilities. The inverse relationship observed between the mean SCVI scores and sample sizes across several states suggests that smaller samples may capture specific regional extremes or anomalies not present in larger, more representative data sets. This observation necessitates cautious interpretation of data and, possibly, further investigation into these regions. The analysis underscores the need for region-specific cyber 11 Figure 7: Heatmap of the SCVI distribution across the United States, with color intensities reflecting sample sizes to indicate data reliability. vulnerability assessments and tailored cybersecurity policies addressing unique challenges across states. Enhancing data collection efforts and expanding sample sizes can improve the reliability of future SCVI assessments and develop more effective regional and national cybersecurity strategies. 7 Conclusions, Limitations, & Future Work 7.1 Discussions of Key Findings The findings across both the iPoll and Reddit datasets reveal significant trends in user vulnerabilities and attack characteris- tics. Individuals often exhibit relatively low self-assessed vul- nerability (IVI) yet face scams with high severity (ASI), high- lighting a critical mismatch. This discrepancy underscores the need for targeted interventions to increase awareness and improve coping strategies, mainly because many users appear insufficiently prepared to handle high-impact attacks such as phishing, romance scams, and investment fraud despite engaging in minimal risk-taking behaviors. The dimensions of psychological factors (e.g., impulsivity, credulity, emotional distress) and experiences (e.g., falling for previous scams) proved incredibly influential in shaping vulnerability scores. Users reporting higher impulsivity or emotional distress consistently showed elevated IVI values, emphasizing the interplay between personal disposition and cyber risk. This insight calls for intervention strategies to enhance psychological resilience to mitigate vulnerability. A key strength of the SCVI is its integration of individual- level (IVI) and attack-level (ASI) metrics, surpassing tradi- tional indices such as CVSS, which prioritizes technical vul- nerabilities, and SVI, which emphasizes broad social and in- frastructural vulnerabilities. SCVI’s moderate positive cor- relation with CVSS (𝑟= 0.33) highlights its alignment with technological measures. In contrast, its minimal correlation with SVI (𝑟≈−0.01) demonstrates its unique capability to ad- dress cyber-specific behavioral and psychological dimensions. This refined granularity facilitates more nuanced intervention strategies, such as identifying scam types (e.g., tech support vs. investment) that present the most realistic or effective methods of victimization. Sensitivity and weight variability analyses revealed that Awareness (𝑤𝐴) consistently increased SCVI scores, empha- sizing its exacerbating effect, while Experience (𝑤𝐸) gener- ally mitigated SCVI with some fluctuations due to compo- nent interactions. The Psychological factor (𝑤𝑃) showed a strong positive correlation with SCVI in ipoll but a slight neg- ative effect in Reddit. Contextual differences were notable: lower scam frequencies in Reddit increased SCVI, whereas in iPoll, Sophistication (𝑤𝑆) consistently reduced SCVI by shaping scam perceptions. These findings highlight the need for tailored interventions focusing on awareness, impulsive behaviors, and preparedness for high-severity scams. Geographical analysis using the iPoll dataset showed vari- ations in SCVI scores influenced by regional factors and sam- ple sizes. States with smaller sample sizes, such as Alaska and Rhode Island, often presented higher SCVI scores with wider confidence intervals, suggesting that localized scam dynamics or outlier incidents might skew risk perceptions. In contrast, populous states like CA and TX exhibited lower, more stable SCVI values, potentially reflecting more effective cybersecurity awareness efforts. These disparities underscore the need for region-specific cybersecurity policies, such as community-based digital literacy training and public aware- ness campaigns targeting prevalent scam types. 7.2 Limitations of the Present Research Despite the robustness and novelty of the SCVI framework, several limitations merit consideration. First, both the iPoll survey [1] and Reddit scam reports rely on self-reported data, which introduces risks of recall bias and under-reporting. Users may understate their vulnera- bilities or fail to accurately report certain scam experiences, potentially affecting the reliability of the findings. Second, while the iPoll dataset strives to be nationally rep- resentative, certain demographics, such as older adults with limited Internet access or non-English speakers, may be under- represented. Similarly, Reddit data are prone to self-selection bias, favoring technologically savvy users, which could skew the results toward a specific subset of the population. Third, another limitation stems from sample size variabil- ity. Some states exhibit very small sample sizes, resulting in wide confidence intervals and reducing the reliability of geographical analyses. This emphasizes enhancing data col- lection efforts across diverse regions to ensure more robust and representative findings. Forth, the equal weighting of IVI and ASI components, applied uniformly in this analysis, may oversimplify the com- plex interplay between factors. Future research should explore data-driven weighting methods to refine and optimize SCVI calculations, ensuring a more accurate representation of the 12 dynamics influencing cyber vulnerabilities. Fifth, the cross-sectional nature of the datasets further lim- its the ability to draw causal interpretations and obscures how vulnerabilities evolve. Longitudinal studies are needed to cap- ture dynamic changes in cyber vulnerabilities and provide deeper insights into temporal trends. Furthermore, sociocul- tural variations in trust cues and persuasion tactics restrict the generalizability of SCVI to diverse populations. Addressing these cultural specificities in future research is essential to enhance the framework’s applicability across global contexts. Lastly, the continuous evolution of cybercriminal tac- tics necessitates regular updates to the SCVI framework to incorporate emerging scam vectors and adapt to the rapidly changing cyber landscape. These limitations highlight critical areas for refinement and underscore the need for future research to improve the SCVI framework’s adaptability, scalability, and robustness as a com- prehensive metric for assessing social cyber vulnerabilities. 7.3 Future Work To address the identified limitations of the SCVI framework and build on its strengths, several key future research direc- tions are proposed. First, the SCVI offers a holistic perspective on cyber vul- nerability by integrating individual-level risk factors with contextual attack severity. Results from the iPoll and Red- dit datasets illustrate that while many individuals maintain moderate or even low self-assessed susceptibility, they of- ten encounter sophisticated or severe scams. This mismatch underscores the need for targeted interventions address- ing user vulnerability and the high-impact nature of many prevalent cyber threats. SCVI’s modular design, encompass- ing dimensions such as awareness, psychological traits, past experiences, and scam sophistication, facilitates more robust analyses than traditional metrics like CVSS and SVI, primar- ily focusing on software exploits or broad social indicators. Second, efforts should improve the reliability of input data by reducing biases associated with self-reported data. Incorporating alternative data collection methods, such as behavioral tracking or third-party validation of reported inci- dents, can help mitigate recall bias and under-reporting. These methods would provide a more objective foundation for as- sessing vulnerabilities and enhancing SCVI’s robustness. Third, expanding the geographic and demographic scope of SCVI is essential for capturing a more diverse range of cultures, languages, and age groups. This would improve the framework’s applicability and inclusivity. Leveraging di- verse datasets across cultural and linguistic contexts could enhance SCVI’s generalizability. Moreover, addressing un- derrepresented populations, such as older adults with limited Internet access and non-English speakers, would ensure a more comprehensive analysis of cyber vulnerabilities. Fourth, addressing sample size variability, particularly in geographical analyses, is crucial for improving the reliability of SCVI estimates. Increasing sample sizes for underrepre- sented regions and states would reduce confidence intervals and enhance regional assessments. Stratified sampling meth- ods or region-specific weighting schemes could also refine regional vulnerability analyses. Fifth, longitudinal studies are needed to track individ- ual and community-level changes in vulnerability over time. Such studies would provide valuable insights into how behav- iors, awareness levels, and scam tactics evolve in response to emerging threats and mitigation strategies. Temporal anal- yses could facilitate the identification of trends and inform proactive intervention strategies. Sixth, developing data-driven weighting methods repre- sents a promising direction for optimizing SCVI. Incorporat- ing machine learning techniques, such as feature importance estimation or optimization algorithms, would enable dynamic adjustments of IVI and ASI weights based on real-time threat intelligence. These approaches would enhance SCVI’s pre- dictive power and accuracy. Seventh, regular updates to SCVI are critical to maintain- ing its relevance in an ever-evolving digital threat landscape. This includes incorporating emerging scam typologies such as AI-powered phishing and deepfake-related fraud. By adapting to new threats, SCVI can remain a versatile and contextually relevant framework for assessing cyber vulnerabilities. Lastly, addressing cultural specificity is essential for en- hancing SCVI’s global applicability. Sociocultural differences in trust cues, communication styles, and persuasion tactics must be explored to localize the framework. Comparative studies across regions provide deeper insights into cultural and behavioral factors, further refining SCVI. These future research directions aim to enhance the SCVI framework’s adaptability, robustness, and inclusivity. By ex- panding its geographic and demographic scope, integrating data-driven methods, and continuously updating the frame- work to reflect emerging threats, SCVI can become an in- dispensable tool for assessing and mitigating social cyber vulnerabilities in diverse and dynamic contexts. 13 Ethics Considerations This research was conducted with careful attention to eth- ical principles, particularly regarding data privacy and the responsible use of publicly available datasets. 1.
