Rooted in collaborative efforts, cybersecurity spans the scope of cyber competitions and warfare. Despite extensive research into team strategy in sports and project management, empirical study in cyber- security is minimal. This gap motivates this paper, which presents the Collaborative Cyber Team Formation (CCTF) Simulation Framework. Using Agent-Based Modeling, we delve into the dynamics of team cre- ation and output. We focus on exposing the impact of structural dy- namics on performance while controlling other variables carefully. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic team formations, an as- pect often overlooked in corporate cybersecurity and cyber competition teams. Keywords: Cybersecurity · Cyber Competition · Collaborative Teams 1 Introduction Teams, more than just collectives engaged in mutual tasks, present complex dimensions studied across various fields, including organizational sociology, an- thropology, organizational behavior, industrial psychology, sociometry, and so- cial network analysis [8, 17, 31]. Echoing Aristotle’s philosophy that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, comprehending teams is key to understanding the evolution and future trajectory of industrial revolutions [29]. Their potential manifests in enhanced performance, improved quality through error identifica- tion and recovery [28], increased productivity via labor distribution, and foster- ing innovation [25]. As such, optimizing team performance becomes a significant factor for the success of organizations, enterprises, large-scale endeavors, and competitive teams [9, 11]. While teamwork can bolster performance, it may also introduce errors and dysfunction [28]. Factors such as power dynamics, leadership, culture, organiza- tional processes, communication, cohesion, and team composition influence team performance [18]. This was demonstrated in FIFA’s 2002 World Cup when the 1998 winning French team, despite retaining over 80% of its members [2, 3], and led by the same captain, Zinedine Zidane, failed to win any match. This downfall is attributed to a change in team formation from a defensive 4-3-3 in 1998 to a 2 T. Calay et al. more balanced 4-2-3-1 in 2002, catching opponents off guard [1, 4]. Such strate- gies of role configuration are ubiquitous in professional team formation and have been extensively studied in competitive sports and project management [10, 21]. However, such exploration is scant in the cybersecurity domain. This study aims to fill this gap and hypothesizes that team formation strate- gies significantly affect performance and victory probability. Utilizing computa- tional modeling, we simulated a Blue team/Red team cyber competition, where teams were given two unique roles. The performance was assessed based on role configuration. To eliminate skill biases, we developed roles using Agent-Based Modeling, focusing on the impact of team formation strategies and network properties on performance. This work serves as an initial stride in comprehending the performance of cyber teams, laying the groundwork for the development of the Collaborative Cyber Team Formation (CCTF). CCTF is a three-pillared framework that we are building to dissect the performance of cyber teams. The first pillar of CCTF is rooted in theoretical research that explores collaborative systems, particularly through the lenses of game theory, social learning, and complex systems. The second pillar hinges on the empirical analysis of cyber competitions coupled with subject matter expertise. The third pillar, to which this work contributes, draws on computational modeling. 2 Implementation Methodology This work aims to assess the influence of team formation strategies on perfor- mance in cyber competitions, considering several influencing factors: – Team Size: Larger teams tend to yield greater collective performance [23], indicating a direct proportionality between team size and performance. – Skills: Teams with higher skills, encompassing talent [19] and training [27], typically outperform those with lesser skills, suggesting a direct correlation between members’ skills and team performance. – Collaboration: More collaborative teams generally perform better [20], im- plying a direct relationship between collaboration and performance. How- ever, talent and collaboration may sometimes be inversely proportional [30]. – Leadership: Teams exhibiting superior leadership and trust usually perform better than those facing leadership crises [13]. – Social Influence: Performance can be swayed by social pressures within the team, like interpersonal dynamics [22], or external pressures, such as crowd influence [16]. This encompasses factors like motivation, stress, and discrimination. To ascertain the impact of team formation distinct from these factors, the study design neutralizes or, when impractical, fixes these influences as detailed in Section 2.1. Moreover, performance is contingent upon specific goal attainment, thus, it is evaluated based on key predefined objectives, as elaborated in Section 2.1. CCTFv1: Computational Modeling of Cyber Team Formation Strategies 3 − 2.1 Study Design In our study, a cyber competition is modeled as a defender team safeguarding a network against an attacker team. Following the models established in [14, 15], the network is constituted of interconnected nodes, with only the peripheral nodes (internet-facing) being accessible to attackers initially. On successfully overtaking a peripheral node, attackers can target linked nodes. Figure 1(a) depicts such a network, where peripheral nodes in the yellow region are exposed to attack attempts (black arrows). Non-peripheral nodes in the green region are unreachable directly but become accessible (blue arrows) once a peripheral node is compromised (red arrow). (a) Modeling the network and at- tackers (b) Attacker and defender roles matched to EC-Council’s hacking and incident handling steps Fig. 1: Modeling study agents In our model, each attacker assumes one of two distinct roles: a “scout” or an “exploiter”. The scout scans accessible nodes to detect vulnerabilities, with the probability of successful detection—given a node is vulnerable—set by the user and defined as: P (detect | node is vulnerable) = Pscout Once a scout identifies a vulnerability, exploiters are notified to attempt to ex- ploit this vulnerability and control the compromised node. The probability of successful exploitation—given a node is vulnerable—is set by the user as: P (exploit | node is vulnerable) = Pexploiter Systematically, the scout performs the initial two hacking steps as defined by EC-Council [5], as illustrated in Figure 1(b). In parallel, the exploiter is sys- tematically characterized as the role executing steps 3 through 5. The attacker team consists of s scouts and N s exploiters, where N denotes the total team size. To mitigate the influence of ”team size,” as outlined in section 2, this study 4 T. Calay et al. − maintains constant and equivalent team sizes for both attacker and defender teams. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is employed to curtail the impact of “skills”, “collaboration”, and “social influence” (detailed in Section 2.2). Identical agents mitigate “skills”, while broadcasting communication and anonymous interac- tions limit “collaboration” and “social influence”, respectively. An ad-hoc team arrangement, with a user-determined size (N ), helps manage the “leadership” factor. Success in a cyber-attack hinges on its objectives; this study outlines three unique objectives and corresponding metrics (Table 1). Table 1: Measured Objectives Index Objective Metric 1 Overtake as many nodes as possible Portion of the network overtaken by the attackers. This metric is a decimal number ranging between 0 and 1. 2 Overtake the whole network Whether the whole network was overtaken by the at- tackers. This metric is a Boolean. 3 Overtake the central nodes repre- senting core services such as the database Whether the central nodes were overtaken by the at- tackers. This metric is a Boolean. In our model, each defender can assume one of two distinct roles: a “detector” or an “interceptor”. The detector scans the network for compromised (exploited or overtaken) or vulnerable nodes. The probability of successfully identifying an infected node—given that it is indeed infected—is set by the user and defined as: P (detect | node is infected) = Pdetector−exploited while the probability of successfully identifying a vulnerable node—given that it is indeed vulnerable—is set by the user and defined as: P (detect | node is infected) = Pdetector−vulnerable Upon detection of an infected node, interceptors are alerted to defend the net- work. The interceptor can either flag the infected node as untrusted—thus iso- lating it [12, 24, 26]—or recover the node based on user-defined action. The in- terceptor requires time ∆interceptor, set by the user, to carry out this action. The detector is systematically aligned with the first three steps of incident han- dling, as defined by EC-Council [6], as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Similarly, the exploiter is systematically defined as the role that performs step 4. The team of defenders is composed of d detectors and N d interceptors. The same measures implemented to limit the impact of the factors defined in section 2 on attacker team’s performance are implemented to limit the impact on defender team’s performance. Hypothesis As noted in section 2.1, team performance, gauged by the three metrics, is influenced by the team formation strategies of both attackers and defenders. In this section, we posit that team formation strategies notably impact performance and the likelihood of victory. Given that team formation invariably precedes performance and potential confounding factors have been controlled, correlation analysis remains necessary for deciding whether to accept or reject the proposed hypothesis. CCTFv1: Computational Modeling of Cyber Team Formation Strategies 5 2.2 Study Parameters Our methodology utilizes an Agent-Based Modeling approach featuring five agent types: Router, Scout, Exploiter, Detector, and Interceptor. These are illus- trated in our NetLogo simulation, as shown in Figure 2. While the network size and structure can be user-specified, for the rest of this paper, we are considering a scale-free network with 30 routers. Each input parameter can accommodate a broad spectrum of values; however, for demonstration, we have used incremental values iteratively as enumerated in Table 2. It is notable that every tick triggers packet generation and routing table broadcasts, with the simulation offering real-time status updates to emulate a realistic network model. The workflow, outlined in Figure 3, involves offline routers becoming active again once the simulation surpasses their shutdown delay. Meanwhile, scouts and detectors can identify vulnerable routers, exploiters have the capacity to compromise routers, and interceptors can both shut down and rehabilitate routers.

Given the inherently stochastic nature of the simulation, we performed five trials for each setup to capture possible output variations. Each result is evaluated against the three objectives, as described in section 2.1, employing three established metrics. As a result, we derived a dataset comprising 6480 distinct combinations and corresponding outcomes. This dataset, along with the source code [7] for reproducibility and validation, is publicly accessible. The results are represented graphically in section 3.1. We subsequently posit and scrutinize a hypothesis using this assembled dataset in section 3.2. 3.1 Sample Results In this section, we showcase the derived dataset via graphical representation. All diagrams, as depicted in figures 4 and 5, employ the number of Exploiters 6 T. Calay et al. — − Fig. 2: NetLogo simulation snapshot Fig. 3: NetLogo simulator workflow diagram (N s) as the y-axis and the number of Interceptors (N d) as the x-axis. The z- axis corresponds to the utilized metric for all configurations and tests. A router is deemed compromised from the instant it is exploited until recov- ery initiation by an interceptor. Similarly, a router is classified as offline from the commencement of its recovery (or that of its root router) until successful recuperation. Tracking both compromised and offline routers is paramount, as CCTFv1: Computational Modeling of Cyber Team Formation Strategies 7 − − (a) Mean compromised routers (b) Max compromised routers (c) Mean offline routers (d) Max offline routers Fig. 4: Team performance measured following “Metric 1” the former represents the infiltrated network and the success of the attackers, while the latter signifies the network’s containment and the defenders’ success in thwarting the attack. However, both are critical for “Metric 1” (defined in section 2.1). Figure 4(a) illustrates the mean percentage of the network compro- mised throughout the test, while Figure 4(b) displays the maximum percentage. Likewise, Figures 4(c) and 4(d) represent the mean and maximum percentages of the offline network over the test duration, respectively. These four figures all utilize the same axes: number of interceptors (N d), number of exploiters (N s), and network percentage. These visuals collectively indicate that, per metric 1, the defenders’ optimum performance is achieved with a formation of 8 detectors and 2 interceptors. However, this team structure doesn’t consistently yield superior performance in other configurations. In accordance with metrics 2 and 3, depicted in figures 5(a) and 5(b), re- spectively, the defenders’ formation of 8 detectors and 2 interceptors does not consistently exhibit top performance. The ideal formation for defenders is con- 8 T. Calay et al.

It’s also important to acknowledge that these results are based on the sample configuration and are furnished for illustrative purposes. A more comprehensive analysis will follow. 3.2 Hypothesis Testing In section 2.1, we hypothesized that team formation strategies impact perfor- mance and the likelihood of victory. To test this hypothesis, we compute the cor- relation coefficient (R values) to gauge the strength of the relationship between two variables, thereby allowing us to understand and evaluate their statistical association independent of any extraneous variables. Table 3 presents the corre- lation between the performance metrics (defined in section 2.1, extracted from the generated dataset, and depicted in figures 4 and 5) and the Attacker/De- fender strategies. In this study, our hypothesis is validated, as there exists a significant negative correlation between the strategies of the attackers/defenders and the designated metrics. As the quantity of Attacker exploiters or Defender interceptors escalates, we observe a corresponding decline in metrics, and vice versa.

To investigate this hypothesis, we adopted a computational approach, and the results yielded significant findings that support the acceptance of the hypothesis. Moving forward, our next endeavor involves validating and potentially calibrating this computational model using empirical data collected from a competition. To ensure the integrity of the study, the competition will be organized as a controlled experiment, effectively minimizing the influence of other factors that could introduce biases. This work serves as a foundational component in the development of the Collaborative Cyber Team Formation (CCTF) framework, which aims to integrate theoretical, empirical, and computational approaches to comprehensively understand the performance dynamics of cyber teams.
