Digital Adoption and Cyber Security: An Analysis of Canadian Businesses∗ Joann Jasiak† Peter MacKenzie‡ Purevdorj Tuvaandorj§ April 18, 2025 Abstract This paper examines how Canadian firms balance the benefits of technology adop- tion against the rising risk of cyber security breaches. We merge data from the 2021 Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use and the 2021 Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime to investigate the trade-off firms face when adopting digital technologies to enhance productivity and efficiency, balanced against the poten- tial increase in cyber security risk. The analysis explores the extent of digital technology adoption, differences across industries, the subsequent impacts on efficiency, and associ- ated cyber security vulnerabilities. We build aggregate variables, such as the Business Digital Usage Score and a cyber security incidence variable to quantify each firm’s digital engagement and cyber security risk. A survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator is em- ployed, and a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models is introduced to iden- tify the drivers of technological efficiency and cyber risk. The analysis reveals a digital divide linked to firm size, industry, and workforce composition. While rapid expansion of tools such as cloud services or artificial intelligence can raise efficiency, it simultaneously heightens exposure to cyber threats, particularly among larger enterprises.

For businesses, adopting digital tech- nologies is no longer optional; it is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a globalized market. However, with greater reliance on digital tools comes an increased exposure to cyber security risks. Understanding this trade-off —the efficiency gains from digital adoption versus the vulnerabilities it introduces is critical for Canadian businesses. This study examines the extent of digital technology adoption and cyber security prac- tices among Canadian firms, using a novel dataset that combines information from the 2021 Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use (SDTIU) and the 2021 Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime (CSCSC). To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the most recent version of the CSCSC dataset, offering an opportunity to explore both digital adoption and cyber security. These surveys provide detailed data on firms’ adop- tion of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and enterprise management systems, as well as the frequency, severity, and impact of cyber security incidents on business operations. The primary objective of this paper is to explore the trade-off between digital adoption and cyber security risk, by examining how technological advancement can enhance productivity while simultaneously increasing firms’ vulnerability to cyber threats. Specifically, we analyze which types of firms are adopting digital technologies, how adoption levels vary across indus- tries, and whether these technologies are increasing cyber security incidents. We also inves- tigate the firm-specific factors such as size, industry, and employee characteristics that shape both technological efficiency and the ability to manage cyber security risks. Our methodolog- ical contributions include introducing the Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS) to quantify digital adoption, enabling a comparative analysis of firms’ engagement with digital technolo- gies. Given the large number of firms and the high dimensionality of mostly qualitative ex- planatory variables in our dataset, we introduce high-dimensional logit models estimated via a Lasso-penalized maximum likelihood estimator with survey weights to ensure representa- tiveness of Canadian firms. We use a debiasing method for inference on the selected model’s coefficients and establish its asymptotic validity. To assess how closely firms operate to their technological usage frontier, we apply stochastic frontier analysis. Additionally, we employ k- means clustering to categorize firms by technological efficiency, facilitating the identification 2 of distinct profiles of digital adoption and efficiency. The literature on digital technology adoption emphasizes its role in improving firm pro- ductivity. Larger firms are often better positioned to implement these technologies, benefiting from economies of scale and greater access to resources (Leung et al., 2008). In contrast, smaller firms frequently encounter barriers, including high costs of implementation and lim- ited technical expertise, which can hinder their ability to fully realize the potential benefits of digital adoption. Ferrari (2012) demonstrates that industry-specific differences in digital readiness significantly affect adoption rates, while Aghimien et al. (2021) highlight the role of regional policies in either enabling or constricting firms’ technological advancement. To- gether, these studies emphasize the structural factors shaping disparities in digital technology adoption across firms. In Canada, Bilodeau et al. (2019), using data from the 2017 CSCSC, show the widespread reliance of Canadian businesses on digital technologies. They report that about 92% of Cana- dian businesses used one or more digital technologies or services in 2017, with significant increases in the adoption of websites and social media integration since 2013. In addition, just over one-fifth of Canadian businesses reported being impacted by cyber security incidents that affected their operations, with 54% noting that these incidents prevented employees from carrying out day-to-day work and about 30% experiencing additional repair or recovery costs. While digital adoption can boost productivity, it also introduces new risks, particularly related to cyber security. The Geneva Association, a leading international think tank of the insurance industry, defines cyber risks as breaches in confidentiality, availability, and data integrity, posing operational threats to firms that increasingly rely on interconnected digital systems (Eling et al., 2016). Cebula and Young (2010) expand on this definition, framing cyber risks as disruptions that extend beyond information technology (IT) systems to affect broader business stability. In Canada, the Toronto Public Library system experienced significant disruptions following a cyberattack, while the Nova Scotia Health Department faced operational delays and data breaches during a similar event (Bridge and Zoledziowski, 2024; Bousquet, 2023). The adoption of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and enterprise management systems could increase cyber security risks. Blichfeldt and Faullant (2021) high- light that while these systems can improve productivity, their complexity often introduces integration challenges that, if poorly managed, can undermine business operations. Addition- ally, the widespread use of interconnected devices has expanded the potential attack surface for cybercriminals, requiring firms to invest more heavily in cyber security infrastructure. 3 Remote work adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the reliance on digital tools but also introduced new risks and challenges. Hackney et al. (2022) find that firms effectively utilizing digital technologies during the pandemic demonstrated resilience in main- taining operations under lockdown conditions. However, Aczel et al. (2021) and Kitagawa et al. (2021) report that the rapid shift to remote work led to heightened employee burnout and increased risks of phishing attacks, underscoring the broader implications of accelerated digital adoption. Cyber insurance is a tool for mitigating cyber security risks. According to the OECD (OECD, 2017), the cyber insurance market doubled in size between 2015 and 2020, fueled by firms’ increasing awareness of cyber threats. However, Fitch Ratings (Fitch Ratings, 2021) highlights that high premiums and restrictive coverage policies hinder adoption, especially among smaller firms. Globally, cyber security spending is projected to surpass $170 billion by 2026 (Gartner, Inc., 2021). Despite the growing demand for cyber insurance, firms may strategically underinvest in cyber security measures due to the unobservable nature of such investments. Ahnert et al. (2022) argue that firms may prioritize visible innovations over less transparent risk mitigation strategies, as clients are often unable to directly evaluate cyber security expenditures. This dynamic creates a paradox in which firms recognize the increasing risks of digital adoption but fail to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate them effectively. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets used in the study, the SDTIU and the CSCSC, as well as the construction of the associated scores and variables. Section 3 outlines the paper’s main contribution and methodological framework: the survey- weighted debiased logit Lasso method. Section 4 presents the empirical results, discussing the key determinants of technological efficiency and cyber security vulnerabilities. We conclude in Section 5 with a discussion of the implications of our findings for Canadian businesses and policymakers. The appendix is divided into two parts: Appendix A provides additional technical details on the survey-weighted debiased logit Lasso model, and Appendix B outlines the questions that comprise the BDUS and the Cyber Security Incidence indicator. 2 Data Description and Variable Construction The empirical analysis is based on a merged dataset from two Statistics Canada surveys: the 2021 SDTIU and the 2021 CSCSC. These surveys were merged using firm size and industry 4 classifications from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), enabling an integrated study of digital adoption and cyber security risks among Canadian businesses.1 The SDTIU focuses on digital technology adoption, including metrics such as internet usage, e-commerce participation, and ICT adoption, while the CSCSC examines cyber security practices and the impact of cyber incidents on businesses. The merged dataset includes both qualitative variables, such as the implementation of specific technologies and cyber security measures, and quantitative variables, such as cyber security expenditure and incident-related costs. Together, the surveys cover numerous variables relevant to digital adoption and cyber security. The firms vary in size, ranging from small enterprises with fewer than 10 employees to large corporations with over 500 employees. The industries covered include manufacturing, retail, professional services, and information technology. Both surveys apply stratified sampling by industry and firm size, with survey weights correcting for selection probabilities, non-responses, and sampling biases. These weights ensure that the results are representative of the broader population of Canadian enterprises. The SDTIU achieved a response rate of 73%, while the CSCSC had a response rate of 65%. The pre-matched weighted samples cover 327,567 enterprises for the SDTIU and 185,644 for the CSCSC. After merging, the final dataset comprises a weighted sample of 179,657 enterprises, ensuring comprehensive coverage across various business demographics. Below, we introduce aggregate measures of digital technology usage: BDUS in Section 2.1, a separate measure of Business Technological Efficiency (based on k-means clustering) in Section 2.2, which examines whether firms encounter significant challenges in implementing the technologies they adopt, and an indicator for Cyber Security Incidence in Section 2.3. 2.1 Business Digital Usage Score The BDUS is a quantitative variable constructed to evaluate the digital engagement of Cana- dian firms by measuring the technologies they have adopted. It condenses responses from the 2021 SDTIU into a single, interpretable score that reflects the cumulative utilization of digital tools across ten distinct domains, such as cloud computing, digital payment systems, artifi- cial intelligence (AI), smart devices, online sales, government digital connectivity, fiber-optic internet, and company websites (see Appendix B for the exact questions). 1Methodological differences between the surveys include variations in enterprise size definitions (for small firms: SDTIU defines small firms as those with 5–49 employees, while CSCSC defines them as 10–49 employees) and potential differences in primary respondents’ understanding of their enterprise’s operations. Additionally, the surveys differ in target populations, including NAICS and enterprise size requirements. 5 For each of the ten domains, we create a binary variable equal to 1 if the firm reports using that technology. Summing these indicators yields a score between 0 and 10, with higher values indicating more extensive digital engagement. Although it is conceivable that advanced tech- nologies (e.g., AI) have disproportionate impacts on firm productivity compared to simpler ones (e.g., a basic website), weighting them by perceived importance would introduce addi- tional assumptions. Firms also have heterogeneous technological needs, some rely heavily on cloud computing for scalable data storage, while others benefit more from online payment sys- tems or data analytics. Therefore uniform summation provides a transparent, easily replicable index of a firm’s overall digital footprint. 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Frequency Figure 1: Histogram of Business Digital Usage Scores Figure 1 shows the distribution of BDUS scores. The majority of firms fall within scores of 3 to 7, suggesting moderate overall adoption levels, with mild peaks at 4 and 6. At the extremes, a small proportion of firms report virtually no digital engagement (score = 0), whereas another small subset achieves near-comprehensive adoption (scores of 9 or 10). This dispersion highlights the heterogeneity of adoption patterns: some businesses implement only a handful of relevant technologies, while others adopt a wide array. It is important to note that the BDUS does not measure the intensity of usage or the ease of integration. Rather, it provides a concise snapshot of whether certain well-known tools have been adopted in at least a basic form. We use the BDUS to investigate the characteristics of firms that adopt digital technologies through a stochastic frontier model in Section 4, measuring how close businesses are to their technological frontier. Additionally, we use the BDUS to assess whether having a more extensive digital profile correlates with cyber risk exposure (Table 1). 6 2.2 Business Technological Efficiency While the BDUS captures which digital technologies firms adopt, it does not gauge how well these technologies are integrated. To address this, we construct a measure of Technological Efficiency by applying a k-means clustering algorithm to a set of SDTIU survey items about technological implementation challenges. Specifically, these survey items parallel the BDUS domains but ask whether the firm experiences difficulties using each technology, whereas the BDUS questions simply ask if firms use each technology. The exact questions used in this clustering exercise are listed in Appendix B. Let {zi1, zi2, . . . , zi10} be binary indicators for firm i, capturing whether it reports a chal- lenge in each of the ten domains. A response of “Yes” indicates an operational problem in using the technology associated with that domain. We apply k-means clustering to these ten binary variables and determine that k = 2 is the optimal cluster count, resulting in two groups: Digitally Efficient and Not Digitally Efficient. Figure 2 displays the percentage of reported challenges in each domain for these two clusters. Firms in the latter cluster (52,505 businesses) report significantly more issues than those in the former (127,152 businesses). For example, 70.71% of Not Digitally Efficient firms cite difficulties with AI, compared to 23.58% in the Digitally Efficient group. Similarly, 57.55% of Not Digitally Efficient firms encounter challenges with cloud computing, versus only 3.21% among Digitally Efficient firms. The high incidence of challenges among Not Digitally Efficient firms does not imply that they fail to adopt these tools. Some businesses report both a high BDUS score (indicating widespread adoption) and frequent operational issues, suggesting partial or suboptimal imple- mentation. Even in the Digitally Efficient cluster, a non-trivial share of firms faces difficulties in at least one domain. This k-means classification yields a binary variable, Technological Efficiency, which we use as a dependent variable in one of the logit models in Section 4. Whereas the BDUS measures the extent of adoption, the Technological Efficiency grouping reflects the firm’s ability to use the technology effectively. In this sense, the two measures are complementary: the BDUS indicates how many digital tools a firm adopts, while the logit model using the Technological Efficiency variable reveals whether the adopted technologies are being used efficiently. 2.3 Cyber Security Incidence To examine the cyber security challenges faced by Canadian businesses, we construct a set of variables based on survey responses related to the occurrence of cyber security incidents.

This binary variable is coded as 1 if the business reported experiencing one or more types of cyber security incidents, and 0 otherwise. These incidents range from theft of assets, business data, or intellectual property to disruptions of business activities. Of the 179,656 surveyed firms, 39,524 (22%) reported at least one such incident, while the remaining 140,132 (78%) reported none. Figure 3 shows the occurrence of these incident types among the 39,524 firms that experi- enced any cyber incident. The most frequently cited issues included incidents to steal money or demand ransom payment (37%), incidents with an unknown motive (39%), incidents to steal personal or financial information (33%), incidents to disrupt or deface the business or web presence (18%), and incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas (20%). Fewer respondents reported incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data (9.8%) and incidents to monitor and track business activity (9.2%). We use this binary Cyber Security Incidence variable in subsequent analyses for two pri- mary reasons. It serves as a dependent variable in the cyber security incidence logit model (Section 4), where we identify which firm characteristics and digital adoption practices predict a higher likelihood of experiencing an incident. The Cyber Security Incidence variable is also 8 0 10 20 30 40 50 Deface/Disrupt Web Monitor Business Ransom/Steal Money Steal Personal/Financial Info Steal/Manipulate Data Unauthorized Access Unknown Motive Percentage of Affected Businesses Figure 3: Types of Issues Reported by Businesses After Cyber Security In- cident (Percentage of Affected Businesses) included as a regressor in our stochastic frontier analysis to examine whether having experi- enced a breach correlates with digital technology usage. The rationale is that a prior cyber incident may influence firms’ subsequent decisions or capabilities regarding digital adoption and security investments. A full list of cyber incidence types appears in Appendix B. 3 Estimation Methodology: Survey Weighted Debiased Lasso To estimate models predicting technological efficiency and cyber security incidents, we employ a survey-weighted logistic Lasso (hereafter svy LLasso) estimation technique and introduce a debiasing method for inference. This approach is well-suited to our analysis, as it effectively handles high-dimensional data and incorporates a diverse set of variables, including digital technology usage, cyber security practices, and firm characteristics. Our primary Lasso models include over 50 independent variables, while second-order interaction models expand to more than 200 variables. To accurately represent the population of Canadian businesses, we adapt the standard logistic Lasso method to incorporate Statistics Canada survey weights. To this end, we define 9 the following general ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for a Generalized Linear Model with survey weights, where the svy LLasso estimator is a special case: ˆθ = argmin θ=(α,β′)′∈Rp+1  −Ln(θ) + λ p X j=1 |βj|  , where: • θ = (α, β′)′ includes the intercept α and coefficients β ∈Rp, • Ln(θ) = −n−1 Pn i=1 wig(yi, x′ iθ) is the survey-weighted log-likelihood, where g(y, x′θ) is the negative log-density function (see Appendix A.2 for a detailed description), xi is the regressor vector for firm i, yi is the outcome variable, and wi is the survey weight, • λ Pp j=1 |βj| is the penalty term, with tuning parameter λ, enforcing sparsity by shrinking less relevant coefficients to zero. For our logit models, this approach selects the variables most predictive of technological effi- ciency and cyber security incidents while accounting for survey weights. This framework was adopted by Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) and Jasiak et al. (2024), with the former developing an inference method different from the one we consider below. Inference via Debiasing. For statistical inference on model parameters and average marginal effects (AME) (Appendix A.1), we adapt the debiased Lasso method from Zhang and Zhang (2014) and Javanmard and Montanari (2014) to the survey context described above. Given the ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator ˆθ, the debiasing (DB) method applies a one-step correction: ˜θ = ˆθ + ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ), where ˆH(ˆθ) and S(ˆθ) are the negative Hessian and score function of the weighted log-likelihood function Ln(θ). The adjustment term ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ) corrects the bias introduced by the ℓ1- penalized variable selection, enabling reliable inference. This variant, which uses the standard Hessian, follows Xia et al. (2023), who consider standard GLMs, adapted here for survey weights. We estimate the asymptotic variance of n1/2S(θ0) using a sample information matrix ˆI(ˆθ) (see Appendix A.2), where θ0 represents the unknown true values of θ. For a nonlinear parameter function ρ(θ) (an r × 1 vector, possibly n-dependent), e.g., the AME, we define the debiased estimator: 10 ˜ρ = ρ(ˆθ) + ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ), ˙ρ(θ) = ∂ρ(θ)′ ∂θ . (3.1) Asymptotic Validity. We establish the asymptotic validity of Wald-type inference in the following proposition. To keep the exposition simple, the underlying framework, definitions, and assumptions are provided in Appendix A. Proposition 3.1 (Asymptotic Validity of Survey Debiasing Estimator). Let Assumption 1 hold, and assume that • λ = C q log p n with C = O(1), p ≥1, • p2/n →0, and m0 log p q p n →0 as n →∞, where m0 is the number of non-zero coefficients of θ0, • ρ(θ) (with fixed r < p+1) is differentiable near θ0 with a locally Lipschitz Jacobian ˙ρ(θ), and λmin( ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˙ρ(θ0)) > λl > 0, where λmin denotes the minimum eigenvalue. Then:  ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˙ρ(ˆθ) −1/2 n1/2(˜ρ −ρ(θ0)) d→N(0, Ir). The proof is provided in Appendix A.3. The order of the tuning parameter λ is standard in the literature (Bühlmann and van de Geer, 2011; Negahban et al., 2012; van de Geer et al., 2014; Hastie et al., 2015). The assumptions on the number of covariates p and model sparsity m0 align with those in Xia et al. (2023). In particular, the condition m0 log p q p/n →0 is stronger than the condition m0 log p √n →0 assumed by van de Geer et al. (2014). However, unlike van de Geer et al. (2014), no direct assumption is imposed on the sparsity of the inverse Hessian (or information matrix). The assumption of a locally Lipschitz Jacobian ˙ρ(θ) is slightly stronger than the usual con- tinuous differentiability condition required for testing nonlinear hypotheses (see, e.g., Newey and McFadden (1994, Section 9) and Hansen (2022a,b)). Under this assumption, the estima- tion error arising from the estimation of θ0 and ρ(θ0) becomes negligible. Using this proposition, we make inference on the parameters θ0 and ρ(θ0). In sum, the debiasing approach above offers a straightforward and robust way to analyze high-dimensional survey data, ensuring both variable selection and valid inference in the presence of survey weights. 11 4 Empirical Results The empirical analysis examines the relationship between digital technology adoption and cyber security vulnerabilities among Canadian businesses. We begin by assessing whether broader digital adoption correlates with increased cyber risk (Section 4.1) using rank corre- lations between the BDUS and various security measures. Next, we estimate a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model (Section 4.2), treating the BDUS as an “output” to identify which factors drive a firm toward its digital usage frontier. We then employ logit models with Lasso selection for two binary outcomes: Technological Efficiency (Section 4.3) and Cyber Security Incidence (Section 4.4), allowing us to determine whether the same firm characteris- tics or digital practices that foster greater adoption also enhance implementation efficiency or increase cyber vulnerability. The sample sizes for the analyses are as follows: the svy LLasso results for business ef- ficiency are based on a weighted sample of 175,428 businesses, excluding those with a BDUS score less than 2. The cyber security incidence model uses the full merged dataset, encompass- ing 179,657 businesses. The svy LLasso procedure is implemented using R, where we utilize the default value of the tuning parameter λ from the R package glmnet (see Appendix A.1). 4.1 Digital Technology Adoption and Cyber Security We explore whether a broader digital presence for a firm correlates with heightened cyber risk. Table 1 reports polychoric and polyserial correlations between the BDUS (an ordinal score from 0 to 10) that measures the amount of technology a firm has adopted and various cyber security measures, including firms cyber security spending (continuous variable), a binary indicator for whether or not a firm experienced a cyber incident, and whether or not a firm paid ransom as a result of a cyber security breach. We use polychoric correlation for ordinal to binary comparisons and polyserial correlation for the ordinal to continuous comparison. The positive and significant correlation between BDUS and both cyber security spending (ρ = 0.156∗∗∗) and experiencing an incident (ρ = 0.083∗∗∗) suggests that while digitally en- gaged firms invest more in security, they also face greater exposure to attacks. Firms with a higher BDUS are also more likely to have to pay a ransom as a result of a cyber security breach (ρ = 0.266∗∗∗). The absence of any cyber security measures correlates negatively with BDUS (ρ = −0.068∗∗∗), indicating that firms with minimal digital footprints may perceive fewer threats but also forgo basic protective actions. 12 Table 1: Polychoric/Polyserial Correlations Between BDUS and Cyber Se- curity Measures Cyber Security Measure Correlation p-value Cyber security spending (numeric) 0.156 < 0.001∗∗∗ Experienced a cyber security incident (binary) 0.083 < 0.001∗∗∗ Firm implemented cloud storage (binary) 0.108 < 0.001∗∗∗ Firm paid ransom (binary) 0.266 < 0.001∗∗∗ Firm implemented no cyber security measures (binary) −0.068 < 0.001∗∗∗ Notes: The table reports polychoric correlations for ordinal–binary comparisons and polyserial correlations for the ordinal BDUS and the continuous measure of cyber security spending. All correlations are statistically significant at the 1% level. Significance levels: *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.10. Sample size: 179,657. These correlations provide preliminary evidence of a trade-off: as firms adopt more digital tools (higher BDUS), they may both allocate more resources to cyber security and become more frequent targets of attacks. This finding motivates the proceeding empirical analyses. 4.2 Digital Technology Adoption by Canadian Businesses We estimate an SFA model to examine which firm-level and industry-level characteristics bring businesses closer to their “digital usage frontier.” Treating BDUS (a quantitative score 0–10) as an “output” — that is, the extent to which a firm adopts digital tools — allows us to separate random variation from systematic shortfalls in adoption. The frontier approach is particularly useful because some firms may lag in adopting new technologies for reasons beyond mere chance (e.g., internal constraints or strategic decisions). In this specification, a positive coefficient indicates that the corresponding variable moves firms closer to the frontier of digital adoption. Table 2 presents the maximum likelihood estimates for the logistic SFA model. We use a logistic specification to account for the bounded nature of BDUS, recognizing that moving from, for example, two to three adopted technologies represents a more substantial increase in digital capacity than moving from eight to nine. The explanatory variables are grouped into three categories: Firm characteristics, Digital technologies, and Cyber security measures. After controlling for industry fixed effects, the estimated mean efficiency score across all firms is 77%, suggesting that while most businesses integrate some digital tools, gaps remain. Table 2 indicates that several firm characteristics and digital practices significantly influ- ence how close a business is to its digital usage frontier. Medium (0.085∗∗∗) and Large (0.173∗∗∗) firms both exhibit higher BDUS levels than the Small reference category, while Working from 13 Table 2: Logistic Stochastic Frontier Model for BDUS Variable Coef.

For cyber security measures, the share of Female employees in ICT roles (0.002∗∗∗) is the only strongly significant predictor, indicating that a higher percentage of women in ICT corre- lates with greater digital adoption. The variance parameter estimates confirm that systematic inefficiency (σu) dominates random noise (σv), suggesting that much of the under-adoption of digital tools is rooted in structural constraints rather than chance. These results imply that resource capacity (firm size), remote-work arrangements, and the availability of specific digital tools or managerial practices (e.g., open source, client information management) can propel Canadian firms closer to their feasible frontier of technology usage. Industries such as Construction or Education/Health appear to face adoption barriers, while manufacturing and consumer-facing sectors integrate digital tools more readily. Although extensive digital adoption may heighten cyber threats (Section 4.1), most of the cyber security variables analyzed here do not notably influence how far along a firm is on the adoption curve. 4.3 Technological Efficiency of Canadian Businesses The SFA analysis, using BDUS as the dependent variable in Section 4.2, measures the extent of digital adoption but does not capture how effectively these tools are utilized. To address this distinction, we introduce a binary variable for Technological Efficiency, derived through k-means clustering. This clustering algorithm categorizes firms based on whether they report few or many operational difficulties in using adopted technologies. A firm is classified as “Technologically Efficient” if it experiences relatively few challenges across multiple domains (see Section 2 for details). We restrict the sample to businesses with BDUS ≥2, ensuring a baseline level of digital engagement prior to evaluating efficiency. Table 3 presents the svy LLasso results for the probability of a firm being Technologically Efficient. The independent variables are grouped into three categories: Firm characteristics, Digital technologies, and Cyber security measures. A positive coefficient indicates that the variable increases the likelihood of efficient technology use, while a negative coefficient suggests a reduced likelihood. The final two columns report the AMEs and their corresponding p-values. 15 Table 3: Debiased Logit Lasso Estimation Results for Technological Effi- ciency Variables svy LLasso ˜θDB p-value ^ AME DB p-value Intercept −0.060 0.105 0.606 0.122 0.606 Firm characteristics Medium firm 0.551 0.856 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.158 < 0.001∗∗∗ Large firm 0.366 1.237 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.102 < 0.001∗∗∗ Remote work 0.509 0.664 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.139 < 0.001∗∗∗ Female in ICT roles (1–20%) . 0.486 0.254 0.023 0.720 Female in ICT roles (21–40%) . 0.150 0.688 0.139 0.153 Female in ICT roles (41–60%) 0.211 1.066 0.087∗ 0.123 0.379 Female in ICT roles (>60%) . 0.915 0.273 −0.032 0.214 Foreign market . 0.041 0.873 0.031 0.566 Mining/Utilities/Construction −0.772 −1.108 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.020 0.458 Manufacturing . 0.130 0.411 −0.065 0.044∗∗ Wholesale/Retail/Transport −0.300 −0.416 0.024∗∗ −0.030 0.392 Education/Health . −0.193 0.354 0.113 0.006∗∗∗ Arts/Accommodation/Food 0.256 0.808 0.002∗∗∗ 0.146 0.001∗∗∗ Other services 0.524 1.086 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.146 0.001∗∗∗ Digital technologies Blockchain usage 0.086 1.066 0.153 0.046 0.428 ICT training 0.045 0.314 0.374 0.070 0.327 Online orders . −0.211 0.166 0.006 0.884 AI . 0.205 0.520 0.264 < 0.001∗∗∗ IoT 1.765 1.971 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.156 < 0.001∗∗∗ Computer network 0.661 0.989 < 0.001∗∗∗−0.001 0.968 Customer relationship management . −0.008 0.965 −0.141 < 0.001∗∗∗ Electronic data interchange −0.680 −0.883 < 0.001∗∗∗−0.101 0.007∗∗ Enterprise resource planning . −0.636 0.005∗∗∗−0.168 0.050∗ Big data usage 0.365 1.350 0.019∗∗ 0.076 0.012∗∗ Open source technologies 0.288 0.519 0.007∗∗∗−0.022 0.730 Advertising −0.327 −0.440 0.010∗∗ 0.110 < 0.001∗∗∗ Free advertising 0.431 0.740 < 0.001∗∗∗ 0.073 0.025∗∗ Website 0.399 0.454 0.010∗∗ −0.006 0.852 Company apps . −0.041 0.839 −0.087 < 0.001∗∗∗ Social media −0.287 −0.587 < 0.001∗∗∗−0.027 0.240 Fiber optic . −0.179 0.198 −0.046 0.113 Online sales −0.064 −0.300 0.083∗ −0.013 0.607 Client information management 0.064 0.094 0.498 −0.068 0.019∗∗ Cyber security measures Female in cyber security roles (1–20%) . −0.141 0.708 −0.012 0.815 Female in cyber security roles (21–40%) . −0.077 0.799 0.030 0.443 Female in cyber security roles (41–60%) . 0.202 0.391 0.049 0.166 Female in cyber security roles (>60%) 0.062 0.329 0.123 −0.019 0.487 16 Variables svy LLasso ˜θDB p-value ^ AME DB p-value Cyber security employees (1–2) . −0.127 0.445 −0.003 0.946 Cyber security employees (3+) . −0.020 0.941 −0.014 0.622 Cyber security insurance . −0.090 0.590 0.014 0.537 Employee monitoring . −0.087 0.574 −0.184 < 0.001∗∗∗ Notes: All numeric values are rounded to three decimals. ˜θDB and ^ AME DB denote the debiased logit Lasso coefficient and AME estimates, respectively.

Reference categories: Small firm, 0% female in ICT roles, 0% female in cyber security roles, 0 cyber security employees, and Industry: Professional services. Sample size: 175,428. Table 3 shows that several firm characteristics significantly increase the probability of using digital tools efficiently. Medium ( ] AME DB = 0.158∗∗∗) and Large ( ] AME DB = 0.102∗∗∗) firms exhibit higher AME relative to Small firms. Remote work ( ] AME DB = 0.139∗∗∗) is also associated with increased efficiency. Among digital technologies, the IoT ( ] AME DB = 0.156∗∗∗) and Big data analytics ( ] AME DB = 0.076∗∗) both show strong positive effects, while advertising efforts, such as free advertising ( ] AME DB = 0.073∗∗), also correlate with efficient usage. For industries, Arts/Accommodation/Food ( ] AME DB = 0.146∗∗∗) and Education/Health show a positive marginal effect ( ] AME DB = 0.113∗∗∗) compared to Professional services. Firms endowed with more resources, due to scale (medium or large size) or operational flex- ibility (remote work) can allocate staff and capital to integrate digital systems more effectively. Real-time connectivity from IoT and big data appears to reinforce structured work flows, while advertising activities may align with better-organized digital platforms. Consumer-facing in- dustries, such as Arts/Accommodation/Food may capitalize on digital marketing tools or consumer facing technologies such as reservation systems more readily than sectors facing heavier regulatory or operational barriers. The variables that reduce the likelihood of efficient digital implementation include Elec- tronic data interchange ( ] AME DB = −0.101∗∗∗) and Enterprise resource planning ( ] AME DB = −0.168∗∗). The AME values suggest that more complex systems can pose challenges with technological adoption. The Manufacturing industry ( ] AME DB = −0.065∗∗) has a negative effect based on AMEs, while certain cyber security variables, such as Employee monitoring ( ] AME DB = −0.184∗∗∗), also correlate negatively with Technological Efficiency. These negative or insignificant AMEs point to organizational or regulatory factors that can undermine digital adoption benefits. Complex software solutions (EDI, ERP) often require robust training and IT resources; without sufficient support, firms may experience integration hurdles. Industries like Mining/Utilities/Construction may face specialized work flows or 17 regulatory strictures that may obstruct rapid digital platform adoption. Certain cyber security practices (employee monitoring) can introduce procedural friction or negative employment sentiment that overshadows efficiency gains if not carefully managed. 4.4 Cyber Security Incidence The determinants of Cyber Security Incidence variable are analyzed using a binary dependent variable introduced in Section 2. The Cyber Security Incidence variable equals 1 if a firm reported experiencing at least one cyber security incident during 2021, and 0 otherwise; among 179,656 surveyed firms, 32,371 (18.0%) reported an incident. Cyber incidents encompass a range of adverse events, including theft of business assets, data breaches, disruptions to business activities, intellectual property losses, and other cyber-related issues. Although a large number of independent variables are included in the analysis, relatively few emerge as statistically significant predictors, indicating that cyber risk is shaped by a limited subset of factors.

Reference categories: Small firm, 0% female in ICT roles, 0% female in cyber security roles, 0 cyber security employees, cyber team: diverse employees. Sample size: 179,657. Table 4 displays the svy LLasso estimates for the probability of experiencing a cyber security incident. Among the variables with positive and statistically significant associa- tions are being a large firm ( ] AME DB = 0.057∗∗) and adopting confidential cloud solutions ( ] AME DB = 0.067∗∗∗). In addition, certain industry categories Mining/Utilities/Construction, Manufacturing, Wholesale/Retail/Transport, and Other services exhibit statistically signifi- cant positive coefficients. Two factors show negative and statistically significant effects on the likelihood of a cyber incident. Having over 60% female employees in cyber security roles ( ] AME DB = −0.056∗) and holding cyber security insurance ( ] AME DB = −0.043∗) are both associated with lower probabilities of experiencing an incident. These results suggest that larger enterprises may face heightened cyber risks, potentially reflecting the extensive data infrastructures and more valuable assets characteristic of bigger firms. Reliance on confidential cloud solutions might increase exposure to attacks, as remote and cloud-based systems use electronic methods to store data. Lower incidence rates among firms with higher proportions of female cyber security personnel could indicate that diverse cyber teams are more adept at preventing or responding to threats. Likewise, the negative association of cyber security insurance with incidence likelihood hints that insured firms may adopt more robust preventive strategies to manage their risk profiles. 4.5 Interaction Effects Using an adaptive Lasso approach with polynomial expansions, we investigate whether second- order (interaction) terms enhance the predictive accuracy of our Technological Efficiency and Cyber Security Incidence specifications. We estimate both a first-order (linear) model and a second-order model that includes all pairwise interactions among the explanatory variables. See Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011) for the theoretical background. Table 5 reports mean-squared cross-validation (CV) errors under each specification, along with the penalty parameter λcv. For the Technological Efficiency model, allowing second- order terms substantially lowers the CV error, suggesting that interactions play an important role in explaining efficiency gains from digital technologies. In the Cyber Security Incidence model, the simpler first-order specification yields a slightly lower CV error, indicating that 20 higher-order interactions do not improve predictions of cyber security incidence likelihood. A second-order polynomial specification is justified for the Technological Efficiency model, therefore we re-estimate the svy LLasso model with interaction terms involving firm size, remote work, key technologies, and industry classifications. Table 6 shows the significant interaction terms selected by the svy LLasso estimator, along with their debiased parameter estimates ˜θDB and p-values. Only the interaction coefficients that were selected by the Lasso and statistically significant at the 5% level are included in Table 6. Table 5: Cross-Validation Results for Models With and Without Interaction Terms Model Degree λcv CV Error Preferred Specification Technological Efficiency 1 0.00261 0.92442 2 0.00029 0.34142 Second-order Cyber Security Incidence 1 0.00685 0.87247 First-order 2 0.03132 0.86486 Notes: The table shows the mean-squared CV error from an adaptive Lasso specification with polynomial expansions of different degrees (1 = linear, 2 = second-order interactions). For each model, λcv denotes the penalty parameter that minimizes the CV error. Based on these metrics, the second-order polynomial is preferred for the Technological Efficiency model, while a first-order specification is preferred for the Cyber Security Incidence model.

Variable names are abbreviated for brevity: CRM (Customer Relationship Management), CIM (Client Information Management), EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). Sample size: 175,428. Medium-sized firms exhibit positive and statistically significant interactions with the adop- tion of the IoT (Medium firm × IoT: ˜θDB = 5.554∗∗∗) and firm website use (Medium firm × Website: ˜θDB = 2.934∗∗∗). Remote work arrangements positively interact with social me- dia (Remote work × Social media: ˜θDB = 3.824∗∗∗) and customer relationship management software (Remote work × CRM: ˜θDB = 2.496∗∗). The largest statistically significant positive interaction occurs between company-specific applications and social media use (Company apps × Social media: ˜θDB = 10.627∗∗∗). The pres- ence of female employees in ICT roles (1–20%) interacts positively and significantly with open- source technology adoption (Female in ICT roles (1–20%) × Open source: ˜θDB = 9.104∗∗∗). Online sales and the Mining, Utilities, and Construction industry have a positive statistically significant interaction (Online sales × Mining/Utilities/Construction: ˜θDB = 8.200∗∗∗). Addi- tionally, free advertising positively interacts with firms in the Education and Health industry (Free advertising × Education/Health: ˜θDB = 6.648∗∗∗). The interaction between EDI and advertising is negative and statistically significant (Elec- tronic data interchange × Advertising: ˜θDB = −5.309∗∗∗). Similarly, medium-sized firms show a negative and statistically significant interaction with company-specific applications (Medium firm × Company apps: ˜θDB = −4.019∗∗∗). Remote work arrangements negatively interact with open-source technologies (Remote work × Open source: ˜θDB = −2.598∗∗∗). On- line sales exhibit a negative interaction with firms in the Wholesale, Retail, and Transport industries (Online sales × Wholesale/Retail/Transport: ˜θDB = −4.058∗∗∗). Medium-sized firms benefit from adopting IoT solutions and online platforms, likely due to greater resource availability compared to smaller firms. Remote work enhances the efficiency of communication-oriented technologies, such as CRM and social media. The remote work variable itself also exhibits a strong, statistically significant positive effect on firm technological efficiency. Workforce diversity in ICT roles is positively correlated with technological efficiency, especially when adopting open-source systems. Industry-specific interactions produce varied effects depending on the technology and sector: online sales positively interact with mining, utilities, and construction, while advertising has a positive effect in the education and health sectors. Conversely, interactions like online sales with wholesale, retail, and transport are negatively associated with firm technological efficiency. 23 5 Conclusion This paper contributes new evidence on how Canadian businesses navigate the trade-off be- tween digital technology adoption and heightened cyber security risk. Using data from Statis- tics Canada’s SDTIU and CSCSC surveys, we construct a BDUS to gauge overall adoption levels and then evaluate how effectively businesses use these tools by modeling their technolog- ical efficiency. In addition, we employ a survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator and introduce a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models to identify the drivers of technological efficiency and cybersecurity risk. The stochastic frontier analysis suggests that larger firms, remote work arrangements, and specific advanced technologies (e.g., open-source solutions, client information management systems) can push a firm closer to its digital “frontier.” At the same time, a portion of businesses lag behind feasible adoption levels, as indicated by the high ratio of inefficiency to noise in the frontier estimations. Firms must balance efficiency gains against growing cyber vulnerabilities. Firms that adopt more sophisticated digital technologies or store sensitive data in the cloud often face elevated risk exposure. Our svy LLasso model on cyber incidence confirm that large firms and those using cloud-based services are more likely to report cyber security incidents. However, the pre- dictive power of cyber risk does not improve with second-order interaction effects, suggesting that firm size and core technological choices are the primary drivers of cyber exposure. The two main variables that decreased the likelihood of cyber incidents were firms having cyber security insurance and firms that had a high representation of females in cyber security roles. When it comes to technological efficiency simple linear relationships fail to capture the complexity of how organizational choices, workforce composition, and industry shape digital outcomes. By allowing second-order (interaction) terms, the svy LLasso approach shows that certain combinations of variables such as medium firms adopting IoT, or female ICT repre- sentation interacting with advanced tools like AI can be particularly conducive to efficiency improvements. On the other hand, friction in implementing complex software like EDI or ERP can negate some of these benefits. The analysis demonstrates the importance of firm size and industry. While small firms are sometimes more “locally efficient,” the resource advantages of larger organizations may facilitate deeper or more comprehensive integration of technologies. Industries also differ sub- stantially. In resource- and asset-intensive sectors such as Mining or Construction, strong positive interactions emerge between targeted digital solutions and improved operational pro- 24 cesses, whereas compliance-heavy fields like Education and Health exhibit more negative or complex relationships. Gender composition in ICT roles has meaningful consequences for digital adoption out- comes. Although our results do not prove a causal mechanism, the recurring positive coeffi- cients on interactions involving a share of female ICT staff and advanced technologies suggest that even partial gender diversity in technical teams can amplify the returns to adopting new tools. This pattern is also seen in broader research suggesting that heterogeneity in skill sets and perspectives can catalyze creative problem-solving. The results highlight the balance firms must strike between achieving efficiency gains from digital technologies and managing increased cyber risks. Larger, digitally advanced firms ap- proach their efficiency frontier yet face elevated cyber vulnerability, especially when security practices fall short. Remote work arrangements enhance both digital adoption and techno- logical efficiency without increasing cyber risk exposure. Female representation in ICT and cyber security roles consistently improves outcomes across adoption, efficiency, and cyber se- curity. Certain cyber security practices, particularly obtaining cyber security insurance and ensuring gender diversity within cyber security roles significantly reduce incident likelihood. Reliance on cloud-based services, notably confidential cloud storage, emerges as a risk factor increasing cyber vulnerability. These results suggest policymakers should implement targeted digital strategies tailored by industry and firm size to boost technological efficiency, while simultaneously establishing baseline cyber security practices such as insurance coverage and workforce diversity to mitigate cyber threats effectively. 25 References Aczel, B., Kovacs, M., Van Der Lippe, T. and Szaszi, B.

Tuning Parameter Selection. In the empirical analysis and the small Monte Carlo simu- lations below, the logit Lasso model svyLLasso is fitted using the R package glmnet. For the tuning parameter λ, we use the package’s default value, determined by 10-fold cross-validation with the loss function auc (area under the ROC curve). Average marginal effect in the logit model. We report the marginal effects (ME) for each variable along with the coefficient estimates for logit models in the tables. Let Λ(z) = exp(z)/(1 + exp(z)) be the logistic distribution function. For a dummy regressor ˜xij, where j = 1, . . . , p and i = 1, . . . , n, the ME is defined as: MEij(θ) ≡Λ(x′ iθ)|˜xij=1 −Λ(x′ iθ)|˜xij=0. Given the survey weights {wi}n i=1 corresponding to the observations {(yi, x′ i)′}n i=1, the AME of the j-th regressor is given by: AMEj = AMEj(θ0) ≡E " 1 Pn i=1 wi n X i=1 wiMEij(θ0) # , where θ0 is the true parameter value, and the expectation is with respect to the regressors’ distribution. An estimator for AMEj is: [ AMEj(ˆθ) ≡ 1 Pn i=1 wi n X i=1 wi  Λ(x′ iˆθ)|˜xij=1 −Λ(x′ iˆθ)|˜xij=0  , where ˆθ = (ˆα, ˆβ′)′ is the estimated parameter vector, e.g., the svy LLasso estimator. The de- biased logit Lasso estimator of AMEj is then constructed using the one-step iteration provided in the equation (3.1). A.2 Post-Selection Inference for Survey-GLM Consider the density of a scalar outcome variable yi given a (p + 1) × 1 vector of covariates xi (which includes a constant) specified as f(yi|xi, θ0) = exp(yix′ iθ0 −a(x′ iθ0))c(yi), i = 1, . . . , n, 29 where θ0 is the true value of the parameter vector θ ∈Rp+1, and a(·) and c(·) are known functions. The combined SDTIU and CSCSC data were collected using a stratified sampling scheme, wherein units within each stratum are sampled independently with equal probability. In line with this, we treat wi as fixed (see Wooldridge, 2001), and assume {(yi, x′ i)′}n i=1 to be independent. Let g(y, x′θ) ≡−log f(y, x′θ) and define the weighted log-likelihood function as: Ln(θ) ≡−n−1 n X i=1 wig(yi, x′ iθ). (A.1) The score function, the sample information and negative Hessian matrices corresponding to (A.1) are defined as S(θ) ≡∂Ln(θ) ∂θ = −n−1 n X i=1 wixi ˙g(yi, x′ iθ), ˙g(y, t) ≡∂g(y, t) ∂t , (A.2) ˆI(θ) ≡n−1 n X i=1 w2 i xix′ i ˙g(yi, x′ iθ)2, (A.3) ˆH(θ) ≡−∂2Ln(θ) ∂θ∂θ′ = n−1 n X i=1 wixix′ i¨g(yi, x′ iθ), ¨g(y, t) ≡∂2g(y, t) ∂t2 . (A.4) Moreover, we define H(θ0) ≡E[ ˆH(θ0)] and I(θ0) ≡E[ˆI(θ0)]. We will using the following notations in the assumptions and the proof of Proposition 3.1 below. Let λmin(A) and λmax(A) denote the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix A, respectively. For a real matrix A = (aij), let ∥A∥∞≡maxi,j |aij|, and ∥A∥= q tr(A′A) and ∥A∥2 = q λmax(A′A) denote its Frobenius and spectral norms, respectively. The sub-Gaussian norm of a random variable X is defined as ∥X∥ψ2 ≡supm≥1 m−1/2(E[|X|m])1/m. The sub-Gaussian norm for the random vector is defined as ∥X∥ψ2 ≡sup∥b∥=1 ∥X′b∥ψ2. We establish the asymptotic validity of the debiasing method under the following assump- tions imposed directly on the negative log-density function g(y, t) which are similar to the assumptions employed in van de Geer et al. (2014) and Xia et al. (2023). Let X = [x1, . . . , xn]′. Assumption 1 (Asymptotic validity). (a) {(yi, x′ i)′}n i=1 are independent with max1≤i≤n ai < Cu < ∞a.s. where ai ∈{∥xi∥ψ2, ∥xi∥∞, ∥Xθ0∥∞}. Moreover, wi is non-random with 0 < Cl < wi < Cu for all n, i. 30 (b) For A ∈{H(θ0), I(θ0), E[n−1X′X]}, there exist positive constants λl and λu such that 0 < λl ≤λmin(A) ≤λmax(A) ≤λu < ∞. (c) The function g(y, t) ≡a(t) −yt −log c(y) is convex in t ∈R for all y, and twice differentiable with respect to t for all (y, t). There exist a positive definite matrix H and η > 0 such that λmin(H) > λl > 0 and n−1 n X i=1 E[wi(g(yi, x′ iθ) −g(yi, x′ iθ0))] ≥∥H1/2(θ −θ0)∥2 (A.5) for all ∥X(θ −θ0)∥∞< η. Furthermore, ¨g(y, t) is Lipschitz with some constant L0 > 0: max t0∈{x′ iθ0} sup max(|t−t0|,|˜t−t0|)≤η sup y∈Y |¨g(y, t) −¨g(y, ˜t)| |t −˜t| ≤L0, (A.6) and max t0∈{x′ iθ0} sup y∈Y |˙g(y, t0)| ≤Cu, (A.7) max t0∈{x′ iθ0} sup |t−t0|≤η sup y∈Y |¨g(y, t)| ≤Cu. (A.8) For discussions of these assumptions, we refer to Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023). Simulations. We conduct a simulation experiment to verify the robustness of the debiased logit Lasso inference. We first generate N = 10, 000 draws from a standard logit model as follows: yi ∼Bernoulli(πi), (A.9) where θ0 = (1, 1, 1, 01×(p−2))′, ˜xij ∼i.i.d. Bernoulli(0.5) for j = 1, . . . , p and i = 1, . . . , N, xi = (1, ˜x′ i)′, and πi = x′ iθ0. The population is then stratified into four strata of sizes 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000. From each stratum, we draw 50 and 100 observations with replacement, yielding stratified sam- ples of size n = 200 and n = 400, respectively. Observation weights are wi = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, corresponding to the four strata. To evaluate the impact of regressor dimensionality, we set p such that p n ∈{0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5} for each n ∈{200, 400}. The true AME for θ(2) = β1 is 0.11. 31 We assess the empirical size of the tests by separately testing two null hypotheses: H0 : θ(2) = 1, H0 : AME2 = 0.11. (A.10) The empirical sizes of the DB test and the standard survey t-test (tsvy) at the 5% nominal level are presented in the table below. The standard survey logit tsvy test overrejects by a wide margin, while the DB test exhibits reasonably accurate null rejection rates for both hypotheses in most cases, confirming its robustness to regressor dimensionality.

A.3 Proof of Proposition 3.1 We first prove the following lemma, which establishes the asymptotic distribution of a studen- tized quantity involving the expected Hessian and information matrices, as well as the score function, all evaluated at the true parameters. 32 Lemma A.1. Let Assumption 1 hold and p1+δ0/n →0 for some 0 < δ0 ≤1. Then, as n →∞  ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0) −1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1n1/2S(θ0) d −→N(0, Ir). Proof of Lemma A.1. Let si(θ0) ≡wixi ˙g(yi, x′ iθ0), Xni ≡n−1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1si(θ0) and Σn ≡ Var[Pn i=1 Xni] = ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0). Let νn ≡λmin(Σn). We will verify the conditions of the multivariate Lindeberg-Feller CLT (see e.g. Theorem 9.3 of Hansen (2022b)). First note that E[Xni] = 0 because E[si(θ0)|xi] = −E[xiwi(yi −˙a(x′ iθ0))|xi] = 0. Moreover, we have νn = min τ∈Rr\{0} τ ′ ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0)τ τ ′τ ≥ min τ∈Rr\{0} τ ′ ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0)τ τ ′ ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˙ρ(θ0)τ min τ∈Rr\{0} τ ′ ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˙ρ(θ0)τ τ ′τ ≥λmin(H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1)λmin( ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˙ρ(θ0)) ≥λmin(H(θ0)−1)λmin(I(θ0))λmin(H(θ0)−1)λmin( ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˙ρ(θ0)) = λmin(I(θ0)) (λmax(H(θ0))2λmin( ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˙ρ(θ0)) ≥λ2 l /λ2 u. where the first inequality follows from the extremal property of λmin(·), the second inequality is the eigenvalue product inequality (Hansen (2022a)) and the last inequality is by Assumption 1(b). Next, we will verify the Lindeberg condition: for δ = 2 δ0 > 0 and any ϵ > 0 1 ν2 n n X i=1 E[∥Xni∥21(∥Xni∥≥(ϵν2 n)1/2)] ≤ 1 ν2+δ n ϵδ/2 n X i=1 E[∥Xni∥2+δ] →0. (A.11) First, note that ∥˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1xi∥2+δ ≤∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2+δ  ∥H(θ0)−1xi∥21+δ/2 ≤r1+δ/2∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2+δ 2  λmax(H(θ0)−1H(θ0)−1)∥xi∥21+δ/2 ≤r1+δ/2λ2+δ u ∥xi∥2 (λmin(H(θ0)))2 !1+δ/2 ≤r1+δ/2λ2+δ u (p + 1)1+δ/2C2+δ u λ2+δ l . (A.12) where the first inequality is by Cauchy-Schwarz, the second inequality is by the inequality 33 ∥˙ρ(θ0)∥≤r1/2∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2 and the extremal property of λmax(·), the third inequality is by the eigenvalue product inequality (Hansen (2022a), Appendix B), and the last inequality is by Assumption 1(a) and (b). Thus, using |wi|2+δ|˙g(yi, x′ iθ0)|2+δ ≤C4+2δ u and (A.12), we have n X i=1 ∥Xni∥2+δ ≤ 1 n1+δ/2 n X i=1 ∥˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1xi∥2+δ|wi|2+δ|˙g(yi, x′ iθ0)|2+δ ≤ 1 nδ/2r1+δ/2λ2+δ u (p + 1)1+δ/2C2+δ u λ2+δ l C4+2δ u ≤ (p + 1)1+δ0 n !1/δ0 r1+δ/2λ2+δ u C6+3δ u λ2+δ l →0. This verifies (A.11) and the result follows. Proof of Proposition 3.1 By the mean value expansion, S(θ0) = S(ˆθ) + ˆH(θ∗)(ˆθ −θ0) = S(ˆθ) + ˆH(ˆθ)(ˆθ −θ0) + R, (A.13) where θ∗is the mean-value between ˆθ and θ0, and R = [R1, . . . , Rp+1]′ with Rj ≡n−1 n X i=1 (¨g(yi, x′ iθ∗) −¨g(yi, x′ iˆθ))wixijx′ i(θ0 −ˆθ). (A.14) Note that since ˙ρ(θ) is locally Lipschitz in a neighborhood of θ0, with probability approaching 1 ∥˙ρ(¯θ) −˙ρ(ˆθ)∥≤B0∥¯θ −ˆθ∥for some B0 = O(1). Also, since n1/2(ρ(ˆθ) −ρ(θ0)) = ˙ρ(¯θ)′n1/2(ˆθ −θ0), (A.15) where ¯θ is a mean-value between ˆθ and θ0, we have n1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(¯θ)∥∥ˆθ −θ0∥= n1/2B0∥ˆθ −¯θ∥∥ˆθ −θ0∥= Op(n1/2m0λ2) = op(1), (A.16) where the last line is by n1/2m0λ2 = n−1/2m0C2 log p ≤C2m0(p/n)1/2 log p = o(1). Then, n1/2(˜ρ −ρ(θ0)) = n1/2(ρ(ˆθ) −ρ(θ0)) + ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1n1/2S(ˆθ) 34 = n1/2 ˙ρ(¯θ)′(ˆθ −θ0) + n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′(ˆθ −θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1R = n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1R + op(1), where the first equality is by the definition of ˜ρ, the second equality is by (A.13) and (A.15), and the third is by (A.16). Below, the proof will be completed in three steps: the first two steps establish ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0) = op(1), n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) = op(1), (A.17) and the third step verifies n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1R = op(1). It will then follow that h ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˙ρ(ˆθ) i−1/2 n1/2(˜ρ −ρ(θ0)) = h ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˙ρ(ˆθ) i−1/2 h n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1R + op(1) i = h ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0) i−1/2 n1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) + op(1). Finally, applying Lemma A.1 of and Slutsky’s lemma give the desired result. Step 1: ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0) = op(1). First, by the triangle inequality ∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0)∥2 ≤∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′ h ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1i ˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2 + ∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1( ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0))∥2 + ∥( ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0))′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0)∥2. (A.18) Consider the first term on the right-hand side of (A.18). By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, ∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′ h ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1i ˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2 ≤∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2∥˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2 2, (A.19) After rearranging and using the triangle and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities ∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1 ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2 35 = ∥( ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1)ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 + H(θ0)−1(ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −I(θ0)H(θ0)−1)∥2, ≤∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1∥2∥ˆI(ˆθ)∥2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1∥2 + ∥H(θ0)−1∥2∥ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2. (A.20) For the first summand of (A.20), by Lemma A.2 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) ∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1∥2∥ˆI(ˆθ)∥2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1∥2 = op(1). (A.21) For the second factor in the second summand of (A.20), using the triangle and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities ∥ˆI(ˆθ) ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2 = ∥(ˆI(ˆθ) −I(θ0))( ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1) + (ˆI(θ0) −I(θ0))H(θ0)−1 + I(θ0)( ˆH(θ0)−1 −H(θ0)−1)∥2 ≤∥ˆI(ˆθ) −I(θ0)∥2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1∥2 + ∥ˆI(θ0) −I(θ0)∥2∥H(θ0)−1∥2 + ∥I(θ0)∥2∥ˆH(θ0)−1 −H(θ0)−1∥2 p −→0, (A.22) where the last line is by Lemma A.2 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) and the CMT. From Lemma B.3 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023), ∥ˆθ −θ0∥= Op(m1/2 0 λ) = Op  m0 log p n 1/2 = op(1). Since ˙ρ(θ) is locally Lipschitz in a neighborhood of θ0, with probability approaching 1, we have for B0 = O(1) ∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥≤B0∥ˆθ −θ0∥. Thus, ∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥2 ≤r1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥= Op   m0 log p n !1/2 . (A.23) By the triangle inequality and (A.23) ∥˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2 ≤∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥2 + ∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2 = Op(1). (A.24) Therefore, the quantity in (A.19) is op(1). Consider the second term on the right-hand side of (A.18). By the triangle inequality and (A.23), ∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1( ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0))∥2 ≤∥˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2∥H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥2 p −→0. 36 Similarly, for the third term on the right-hand side of (A.18) ∥( ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0))′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1 ˙ρ(θ0)∥2 ≤∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥2∥H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2 p −→0. Step 2: n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) = op(1). Remark that from Assumption 1, |˙g(yi, x′ iθ0)| ≤Cu, |wi| ≤Cu and ∥xi∥2 ≤(p + 1)C2 u a.s. for all i. Using the independence assumption, E[∥S(θ0)∥2 2] = E[∥S(θ0)∥2] = n−2 E " n X i=1 w2 i ∥xi∥2 ˙g(yi, x′ iθ0)2 # ≤n−1(p + 1)C6 u. By Markov’s inequality, ∥S(θ0)∥2 = Op rp n  . (A.25) Now rewrite n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) = n1/2( ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0))′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) + n1/2  ˙ρ(θ0)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0)  . (A.26) For the first term of (A.26), ∥n1/2( ˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0))′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0)∥2 ≤n1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ) −˙ρ(θ0)∥2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1∥2∥S(θ0)∥2 = n1/2Op   s m0 log p n  Op(1) Op rp n  = Op   s p m0 log p n   = op(1), (A.27) where the first inequality is by Cauchy-Schwarz, the first equality uses ∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1∥2 = Op(1). as shown in the proof Lemma 3.5 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023), (A.23) and (A.25), and the last equality holds because m0(log p)p/n ≤m0(log p)(p/n)1/2(p2/n)1/2 →0 by the assumption 37 of the proposition. For the second term of (A.26), we have n1/2∥˙ρ(θ0)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0)∥2 ≤n1/2∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1 −H(θ0)−1∥2∥S(θ0)∥2 = n1/2Op rp n + m0λ  Op rp n  = Op   s p2 n + √p m0λ   = op(1), (A.28) where the first inequality is by Cauchy-Schwarz, the first equality is by by Lemma A.2 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) and (A.25), and the last equality holds because p2/n →0 and p1/2 m0λ = Cm0(p/n)1/2(log p)1/2 ≤Cm0(p/n)1/22 log p →0 by the assumption of the proposition. It follows from (A.26), (A.27) and (A.28) that n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0) −n1/2 ˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) = op(1). Step 3: n1/2 ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1R = op(1). By Cauchy-Schwarz, n1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′ ˆH(ˆθ)−1R∥2 ≤n1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1R∥2. Remark from (A.24) that ∥˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2 = Op(1). To show n1/2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1R∥2 = op(1), note that max 1≤j≤p+1 |Rj| ≤n−1 n X i=1 |¨g(yi, x′ iθ∗) −¨g(yi, x′ iˆθ)||wi| max 1≤j≤p+1 |xij||x′ i(θ0 −ˆθ)| ≤n−1 n X i=1 L0|xi(θ∗−ˆθ)|C2 u|x′ i(θ0 −ˆθ)| ≤L0C2 un−1 n X i=1 |x′ i(θ0 −ˆθ)|2 = L0C2 uOp(m0λ2) = Op(m0λ2), (A.29) where the first inequality is by Assumption 1(c), and the first equality uses Lemma B.3 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023). Since ∥H(θ0)∥= O(1) and ∥ˆH(ˆθ)−H(θ0)∥= op(1), ∥ˆH(ˆθ)∥= Op(1). Therefore, n1/2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1R∥2 ≤n1/2∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1∥2∥R∥2 ≤n1/2 ˆH(ˆθ)−1(p + 1)1/2∥R∥∞ 38 = Op((n(p + 1))1/2m0λ2) = op(1), (A.30) where the first equality holds by using (A.29) and the second equality follows on noting that (n(p + 1))1/2m0λ2 = (n(p + 1))1/2m0C2(log p)/n ≤(2p/n)1/2m0C2 log p = o(1). B Survey Questions Used for Variable Construction This appendix provides the survey questions used to construct the Cyber Score, the k-means clustering variables, and the Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS). Each set of questions corresponds to specific aspects of digital technology adoption and cyber security challenges. B.1 Cyber Security Incidence Variable Construction The Cyber Security Incidence variable is equal to 1 if a firm answers “Yes” to one of the following questions and 0 otherwise. To the best of your knowledge, which cyber security incidents impacted your busi- ness in 2021? Select all that apply. • Incidents to disrupt or deface the business or web presence. • Incidents to steal personal or financial information. • Incidents to steal money or demand ransom payment. • Incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data. • Incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas. • Incidents to monitor and track business activity. • Incidents with an unknown motive. B.2 Questions Used for k-means Clustering The k-means clustering variables were derived from responses to the following survey questions, which identify challenges businesses face in utilizing various digital and financial technologies. Each affirmative response indicates an inefficiency or challenge: 39 • Does your business face challenges with online transaction processing? • Does your business face challenges with digital marketing? • Does your business face challenges with data analytics? • Does your business face challenges with integrating digital technologies into business operations? • Does your business face challenges with big data? • Does your business face challenges with artificial intelligence? • Does your business face challenges with cloud computing? • Does your business face challenges with ICT infrastructure? • Does your business face challenges with government connectivity? • Does your business face challenges with website operations? B.3 Questions Used for Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS) The BDUS is based on responses to questions about the adoption of specific digital technolo- gies. A “Yes” response to any of the following indicates that the business has utilized the respective technology: • Does your business use online transaction processing systems? • Does your business use digital marketing platforms? • Does your business use data analytics tools? • Does your business integrate digital technologies into business operations? • Does your business utilize big data technologies? • Does your business employ artificial intelligence tools? • Does your business use cloud computing services? • Does your business maintain ICT infrastructure? 40 • Does your business interact with government systems digitally? • Does your business operate its own website? The BDUS score is computed as the total number of “Yes” responses to these questions, with higher scores indicating greater digital engagement. 41
